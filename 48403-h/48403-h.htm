<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There were four of us&mdash;two Frenchmen, an
Italian, and an Englishman. We had ridden from Damascus to Baalbek, and
had seen the ruins; after dinner, we were lying on heaps of cushions on
the floor, in a hostelry little known to Europeans. For some minutes
the bubbling of our narghil&eacute;s was the only sound that broke the
stillness of the night. Then the ex-cuirassier spoke out in a strong
voice&mdash;the voice of a man accustomed to
command&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen! I propose that we solemnly pass a vote
of censure on the late M. de Lamartine.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; was
our unanimous cry; and the vote was carried, <i lang="la">nemine
contradicente</i>. A rider was added, to the effect that poets should
be discouraged from writing books of travel.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Surely a strange proceeding!&rdquo; says the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e209" href="#xd21e209" name=
"xd21e209">vi</a>]</span>reader. Let me explain. We had been shut up in
Damascus for a long time by heavy snow-storms which blocked the roads;
the most interesting book we had was Lamartine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voyage en
Orient,&rdquo; and we had read the long description of Baalbek over and
over again, until we almost knew it by heart. Need I say that the
reality disappointed us? If we had never read Lamartine&rsquo;s book,
we should have been delighted with the place; but having read it, we
wanted the poet&rsquo;s eyes in order to see the temples as he saw
them.</p>
<p class="par">But what has all this to do with Georgia? Simply this:
the following pages are not written by a poet, and, gentle sir, if you
ever pass a vote of censure on the writer of them, it will not be for
the reason that he has painted things and places in a rose-coloured
atmosphere.</p>
<p class="par">In publishing these notes I have had but one
object&mdash;to excite the curiosity of my fellow-countrymen; the means
of gratifying this curiosity are indicated in the bibliographical
section. Georgia is practically unknown to the British public;
well-educated people know that the country is famous for its beautiful
women, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e215" href="#xd21e215"
name="xd21e215">vii</a>]</span>they are not very sure whether those
charming creatures live under Persian, Turkish, or Russian rule, while
not one person in a thousand knows that the Georgians and Circassians
are distinct peoples.</p>
<p class="par">If you suggest that Transcaucasia is a good place for a
holiday, you meet with a look of blank astonishment&mdash;it is just as
if you had said the Sooloo Islands, or Vladivostok. When you explain
that Georgia is now a part of the Russian Empire, you hear stereotyped
remarks about police and passports. The intending visitor need have no
anxiety on this score; even in Moscow a foreigner is seldom or never
put to any inconvenience, in the Caucasus he almost forgets that he has
such a thing as a passport.</p>
<p class="par">There is no reason why Georgia should not become as
popular a resort as Norway or Switzerland. It is not so far away as
people imagine&mdash;you can go from London to Tiflis, overland, in a
week; it is at least as beautiful as either of the countries just
named; it has the great advantage of being almost unknown to tourists;
there is none of the impudent extortion which ruffles our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e221" href="#xd21e221" name=
"xd21e221">viii</a>]</span>tempers nearer home, and it is, after all, a
cheaper place to travel in than Scotland. All these circumstances ought
to have an influence on the holiday-maker in search of health and
recreation.</p>
<p class="par">The botanist, the geologist, the arch&aelig;ologist, the
philologist will all find there mines of rich materials yet unknown to
their respective sciences. The mountaineer knows the country already,
through Mr. Freshfield&rsquo;s excellent book; the sportsman knows it
too, thanks to Mr. Wolley. Artists will get there a new field for the
brush, the pencil, and the camera. But, after all, Georgia&rsquo;s
chief attraction lies in its people; the Georgians are not only fair to
look upon, but they are essentially a lovable people; it is a true
proverb that says, &ldquo;The Armenian&rsquo;s soul is in his head, the
Georgian&rsquo;s in his eyes;&rdquo; to live among such gay,
open-hearted, open-handed, honest, innocent folk is the best cure for
melancholy and misanthropy that could well be imagined.</p>
<p class="par">The language will occur to most people as a difficulty.
Either Russian or Georgian carries the traveller from the Black Sea to
the Caspian, even Turkish is pretty well known; in the larger towns
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e227" href="#xd21e227" name=
"xd21e227">ix</a>]</span>one can always find hotels where French or
German is understood, and where interpreters can be hired. Those who
have travelled know that a very slight knowledge of a language is
sufficient for all practical purposes, and such a knowledge of Georgian
could be picked up in a week or so; Russian is more difficult, both in
grammar and pronunciation. It may be a consolation to some, to know
that a lady, Mme. Carla Serena, who travelled alone, and spent a long
time in the wildest part of the Caucasus, could not speak a dozen words
of Russian or Georgian.</p>
<p class="par">Let me clearly repeat what I said in the first
paragraphs of this preface: in the following plain, matter-of-fact
record of travel my aim has not been to give immediate pleasure, but
rather to show how and where pleasure may be obtained. Autumn is the
best season for a visit, and spring is the next best time.</p>
<p class="par">My hearty thanks are due to Mr. W. R. Morfill, for his
kindness in reading through the chapters on the history and literature
of Georgia.</p>

<h2 class="super">THE KINGDOM OF GEORGIA.</h2>
<h2 class="main">BATUM TO TIFLIS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One morning in April, 1887, after a five
days&rsquo; passage from Odessa, we entered the harbour at Batum.</p>
<p class="par">Batum (<span lang="fr">H&ocirc;tel Imperial, H&ocirc;tel
de France, H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Europe</span>) is a town of 10,000
inhabitants, mostly Georgians; it consists of an ancient Asiatic
quarter, dirty and tumble-down looking, and a European one only seven
years old. Its situation at the foot of the mountains is lovely beyond
all description. The place has a decidedly &ldquo;Far West&rdquo; look
about it, everything seems half-finished; the streets are broad and,
with a few exceptions, unpaved, the depth of the mud varies from three
or four inches to half a yard, heaps of rotting filth furnish food for
numerous pigs, and in the best thoroughfares ducks find convenient
lakes on which to disport themselves.</p>
<p class="par">I took an early opportunity of presenting myself at the
British Vice-Consulate, a small, two-storey <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>cottage, the
lower half of which is of brick, the upper of corrugated iron sheets.
Mr. Demetrius R. Peacock, the only representative of British interests
in the Caucasus, is a man whose services deserve fuller recognition. It
would be hard to find a post where more diplomatic tact is required,
yet he contrives to make himself respected and admired by all the many
races with which he is in daily contact. Mr. Peacock was born in
Russia, and has spent most of his life in that empire, but he is
nevertheless a thorough Englishman. In Tiflis I heard a good story
about him. On one occasion the French Consul-General jokingly said to
him, &ldquo;Why, Peacock, you are no Englishman, you were born in
Russia.&rdquo; To which our representative replied, &ldquo;Our Saviour
was born in a stable, but for all that He did not turn out a
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Although Batum is not very attractive as a town, it is
at any rate far preferable to Poti or Sukhum, and it has undoubtedly a
splendid future before it. Even at the present time the exports amount
to nearly 400,000 tons, chiefly petroleum, manganese ores, wool,
cotton, maize, tobacco, wine, fancy woods, &amp;c. It is essentially a
city of the future; and its inhabitants firmly believe that it will yet
be a powerful rival of Odessa in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>trade, and of the Crimean
coast-towns as a watering-place. At present we should hardly recommend
it to invalids; the marshes round about are gradually being drained;
but they still produce enough malaria to make the place dangerous to
Europeans; the drinking-water, too, is bad.</p>
<p class="par">The harbour is fairly well sheltered, but rather small;
yet, to the unprofessional eye, there seems no reason why it might not
easily be enlarged if necessary. The entrance is protected by a
fortification in the form of an irregular rectangle, lying on the S.W.
corner of the bay, behind the lighthouse. The earthworks, about seventy
or eighty feet high, and lined with masonry, cover a piece of ground
apparently about 300 paces long by 180 paces broad; a broad-gauge
railway surrounds the fortress. When I was there the work was being
pushed forward very rapidly, and preparations were being made to fix a
heavy gun close to the lighthouse&mdash;at that time there were only
about a dozen guns of small calibre in position.</p>
<p class="par">In the town there is absolutely nothing to attract the
stranger&rsquo;s attention; a few mosques and churches, petroleum
refineries, half a dozen European shops, some half-finished public
buildings, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>and the embryo of a public garden on the shore serve
as an excuse for a walk; but if the traveller happens to hit upon a
spell of wet weather, he will soon have seen all he wants to see of
Batum, and will get out of its atmosphere of marsh gas and petroleum as
soon as possible.</p>
<p class="par">The only daily train leaves at eight o&rsquo;clock in
the morning; the station, although it is a terminus of so much
importance, is a wretched wooden building, a striking contrast to the
one at Baku, which would not disgrace our own metropolis. The railway
skirts the sea for about thirty miles, and on the right lies a range of
hills covered with a luxuriant growth of fine forest-trees and thick
undergrowth gay with blossoms; in the neighbourhood of the town there
are already many pretty villas. The rain of the previous few weeks had
made the woods wonderfully beautiful, and the moist air was heavy with
fragrance; I never saw such a wealth of plant life before. At Samtredi,
where the lines from Batum and Poti meet, we leave Guri and Mingreli
behind us and enter Imereti. On the left we now have a fine broad
plain, and near us flows the Rion, the ancient Phasis. The country is
far more thickly populated than Guri or Mingreli, or any other part of
Trans-Caucasia, but it could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href=
"#pb5" name="pb5">5</a>]</span>easily support a much larger number if
the ground were properly worked. I was amazed when I saw, for the first
time, five pairs of oxen dragging one wooden plough, but the sight of
this became familiar to me before I had lived long in Georgia. At the
roadside stations (I need hardly say that our train stopped at all of
them) I saw some fine faces&mdash;one poor fellow in a ragged sheepskin
cloak quite startled me by his resemblance to Dante Alighieri. From the
station of Rion, on the river of that name, a branch line runs
northward to Kuta&iuml;s, none other than the Cyta in Colchis whence
Jason carried off Medea and the Golden Fleece.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kuta&iuml;s</i> (<span lang="fr">H&ocirc;tel de
France, H&ocirc;tel Colchide, H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Italie</span>) is a
beautiful town of 25,000 inhabitants, almost all Georgians. The ruins
of an old castle on the other side of the river show where the town
stood a century ago, and from this point the best view of Kuta&iuml;s
is obtained. Abundance of good building-stone, a rich soil, and plenty
of trees, render the capital of Imereti a charming sight; its elevation
of about 500 feet makes its atmosphere cool and bracing compared with
that of the coast-towns. The traveller who wishes to become acquainted
with Georgian town-life cannot do better than stay in Kuta&iuml;s a
month or two. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>About five miles off is the monastery of Gelati,
built in the tenth century, and renowned as the burial-place of the
glorious Queen Tamara. From Kuta&iuml;s a journey may be made to
Svaneti, the last Caucasian state conquered by Russia, and even now
only nominally a part of the Tsar&rsquo;s dominions; Mr. Wolley&rsquo;s
book, &ldquo;Savage Svanetia,&rdquo; will give the intending visitor
some idea of the sport that may be had in that wild region. The road
across the Caucasus from Kuta&iuml;s to Vladikavkaz is much higher and
wilder than the famous Dariel road, and I much regret that I had not
time to travel by it.</p>
<p class="par">Pursuing our journey from Rion to the eastward we soon
reach Kvirili, which is about to be connected by a branch line of
railway with Chiaturi, the centre of the manganese district; at present
all the ore is carried down to the main line, a distance of twenty-five
miles, in the wooden carts called <i>arbas</i>. Passing through glens
of wondrous beauty, adorned with picturesque ruins of ancient
strongholds, we at length arrive at the mountain of Suram, 3027 feet
above Black Sea level, the watershed which separates the valley of the
Kura, with its hot summers and cold winters, from the more temperate
region drained by the Rion. The railway climbs very rapidly to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>summit of the pass, but it comes down still more
rapidly; there is a slope of one in twenty for a distance of a thousand
feet; at the bottom is the town of Suram with its fine old castle. We
now follow the course of the Kura all the way to Tiflis, passing
Mikhailovo (whence a road runs to Borzhom, the most fashionable
summer-resort in Trans-Caucasia) and Gori, a good-sized town, near
which is the rock city of Uphlis Tsikhe. It is half past nine at night
before Mtzkhet, the ancient capital of Georgia, is reached, and at a
quarter past ten we enter Tiflis, ten hours from Kuta&iuml;s, and
fourteen hours from Batum. Our journey is not yet ended, however, for
it takes half an hour to drive from the station to the fashionable
quarter of the town where the hotels are situated. <span class=

<h2 class="main">TIFLIS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The best hotels are Kavkaz, Rossiya, London; all
pretty good. If the traveller intends to make a prolonged stay, he can
easily find furnished apartments and dine at a restaurant (e.g. the
French Restaurant d&rsquo;Europe, opposite the Palace). The best plan
of all is to board with a Georgian family; but without good
introductions it is somewhat difficult to do this. Although beef only
costs 1&frac12;<i>d.</i> a pound and chickens 2<i>d.</i> each, living
is dear in Tiflis; the necessaries of life, except house-rent and
clothing, are cheap, and one need not, like Alexandre Dumas, pay three
roubles for having his hair cut, but the &ldquo;extras&rdquo; are
heavy, and if the visitor is not disposed to spend his roubles with a
free hand and a light heart, he will meet with a poor reception, for
the Georgian hates nothing more than meanness, a vice from which he
firmly believes Englishmen to be free.</p>
<p class="par">Tiflis takes its name from the hot medicinal springs,
for which it has been famous for fourteen centuries at least; in
Georgian it is called Tphilisi, which philologists assert to be derived
from a root akin to or identical with the Indo-European <i>tep</i>;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>the meaning of Toeplitz and Tiflis is thus the same.
In the fifth century king Vakhtang Gurgaslan founded Tiflis, and began
to build the Cathedral of Sion, which still stands in the midst of the
city. The castle, situated on a high, steep rock, near the Kura, is
older than the city itself, and its construction is attributed to the
Persians. Tiflis has shared in all the triumphs and misfortunes which
have befallen Georgia, and the history of the capital would only be a
repetition of the history of the nation.</p>
<p class="par">The city is built on both sides of the Kura, at an
elevation of 1200 feet, between two ranges of steep, bare hills, which
rise to a height of 2500 feet, and hem it in on all sides, thus it lies
at the bottom of a deep rock basin, and this accounts for the terrible
heat which renders it such an unpleasant dwelling-place in July and
August. The river Kura is crossed by several fine bridges, the best of
which is named after Prince Vorontsov, who during his governorship did
great things for Trans-Caucasia, and gained for himself the lasting
gratitude of all the peoples committed to his care. The population of
105,000 consists not only of Georgians, but of Russians (civil servants
and soldiers), Armenians (traders and money-lenders), Persians, Tatars,
and a few Europeans, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10"
name="pb10">10</a>]</span>viz. Germans (colonists from Suabia),
Frenchmen (milliners, hotel-keepers), &amp;c. Although the English
residents might be counted on one&rsquo;s fingers, it seems a pity that
her Majesty&rsquo;s Consulate should have been closed in 1881; surely
Great Britain has in Georgia interests at least equal to those of
France, Germany, Belgium, and the other nations which have
representatives in Tiflis.</p>
<p class="par">The effect which Tiflis produces on the mind of the
stranger is perfectly unique; its position, its surroundings, the
varied nature of its street-life, the gaiety and simplicity of its
social life, all combine to form a most powerful and most pleasurable
impression. If the reader will mentally accompany me, I shall take him
through some of the more interesting quarters, and endeavour to give
him some idea of the place. First of all, starting from the fashionable
district called Salalaki, let us climb the rocky road which leads to
the ruins of the castle, whence we obtain the finest view of the city.
The best time to enjoy the panorama is evening, and in summer no one
would ever think of making the toilsome ascent much before sunset. From
these crumbling walls one looks over a vast expanse of house-tops and
church spires, through the midst of which winds the muddy Kura. At our
feet lies the old town, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>a labyrinth of narrow, crooked
streets, stretching from the square of Erivan down to the waterside,
where stands the Cathedral of Sion. Quite near at hand the river
becomes very narrow, and advantage of this circumstance has been taken
by building a bridge, which leads to the citadel of Metekh (now used as
a prison) and the large Asiatic quarter called Avlabar. On this side of
the river, forming a continuation of the range of hills on which we are
standing, rises the Holy Mount (Mtatsminda), and perched high up near
its summit is the pretty white church of St. David, behind which rises
a wall of bare, black rock; half-way between it and the river is the
Governor&rsquo;s palace, with its extensive gardens, just at the
beginning of the Golovinskii Prospekt, a long boulevard with fine shops
and public buildings; between the boulevard and the river lies the
Municipal Garden, named after Alexander I. Turning our eyes towards the
other side of the Kura, beyond Avlabar, we see, on the hill facing St.
David&rsquo;s, a large block of buildings used as a military
dep&ocirc;t, arsenal, and barracks, and still farther on, on the river
bank, is a thick green belt which we recognize as the gardens of
Mikhailovskaya Street, ending in the splendid park called
Mushta&iuml;d. Crossing the ridge, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>now turn our back on the
city and descend into the Botanical Garden, situated in a sheltered
ravine, a delightful place for an evening stroll; on the opposite side
of the ravine is a Tatar village with a lonely graveyard.</p>
<p class="par">The Erivan Square is the great centre of activity; in
its midst is the Caravanserai, a vast rectangular building full of
shops, not unlike the Gostino&iuml; Dvor, in Petersburg, but poorer.
From that corner of the square in which is the <span lang=
"fr">H&ocirc;tel du Caucase</span>, runs Palace Street, all one side of
which is occupied by the Caravanserai of the late Mr. Artsruni, a
wealthy Armenian, and behind, in a fine garden, is the Georgian
theatre; both the garden and the theatre belong to the Land Bank of the
Nobles, an institution which deserves the attention of all who are
interested in the Iverian nation. The bank was founded in 1874 in order
to aid farmers to work their lands by advancing them money at the
lowest possible rate of interest; all the profits are spent in the
furtherance of philanthropic schemes and in the encouragement of
national education. It is a significant fact that the more intelligent
members of Georgian society should have chosen this mode of activity in
preference to any other, but the reason of their choice is apparent;
from the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>bitter experience of the last hundred years they
have learnt that although munificence is one of the noblest of the
virtues, extravagance and ostentation are hurtful, and they have,
therefore, wisely determined to do all they can to improve the economic
condition of the country. The public meetings of the shareholders give
an opportunity for discussion and speech-making, and it is in this
&ldquo;Gruzinskii Parlament&rdquo; (as the Russians have nicknamed it)
that Prince Chavchavadze has gained for himself the not unmerited title
of the &ldquo;Georgian Gambetta.&rdquo; I was an occupant of the
Ladies&rsquo; Gallery at one of these assemblies, and I shall never
forget the impression produced upon me by the sight of these handsome,
warlike Asians in their picturesque garb, conducting their proceedings
exactly in the same order as British investors do every day in the City
of London. Try and imagine the heroes of the Elizabethan Age at Cannon
Street Hotel discussing the current dividend of the S.E.R., and you
will have some idea of my feelings.</p>
<p class="par">Only those who have lived the life of the people in
Trans-Caucasia know what a terrible curse the money-lending community
are. A local proverb says, &ldquo;A Greek will cheat three Jews, but an
Armenian will cheat three Greeks,&rdquo; and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Georgian, straightforward, honest fellow, is but
too often cruelly swindled by the artful children of Ha&iuml;k. When
the fraud is very apparent the Armenian often pays for his greed with
all the blood that can be extracted from his jugular vein. During my
stay in Tiflis, a certain wild young prince, Avalov, had made himself
popular by slaughtering a few Armenians; his latest exploit made so
much stir that a prosecution was talked of; but Avalov was no dweller
in towns, he spent his time merrily out in the greenwood, and it would
have needed a company of Kazaks to arrest him. While the authorities
were deliberating, the prince sent a polite message to say that if they
tried to make matters unpleasant for him, he would, with God&rsquo;s
help, devote the remainder of his natural life to running amuck of
every &ldquo;salted&rdquo; Armenian (a reference to their habit of
salting children as soon as they are born) that crossed his path.
Another young nobleman got three years&rsquo; imprisonment for
&ldquo;perforating&rdquo; an insulting usurer, and the cruelty of the
sentence was much spoken of; a lady said to me, &ldquo;Just fancy, that
fine young fellow imprisoned among common criminals for killing a
rascal of an Armenian,&rdquo; as who should say for killing a dog.</p>
<p class="par">Let it be clearly understood that I say nothing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>against the Armenian nation; I have the strongest
admiration for their undoubted literary and administrative talent, and
for the energy with which they resist all attempts to destroy their
national spirit. The Armenian not being a money-lender or trader, is a
citizen of which any country might be proud; but the usurer, whether he
be Jew, Armenian, or Briton, is a most despicable character, and,
unfortunately, the peculiar conditions under which the Armenians have
lived for many centuries have necessarily made Shylocks of a large
percentage of them.</p>
<p class="par">Continuing our walk, we emerge from Palace Street into
the wide Golovinskii Prospekt, which takes its name from Golovin, a
former governor of the Caucasus. On the left lies the palace, a fine
modern building in the European style, and on the right is the
Caucasian Museum, in which the student will find geological,
zoological, ethnographical, entomological, botanical, archeological,
and numismatic collections of the highest interest. On the walls of the
staircase are several large pictures, the most interesting of which
are, a portrait of Queen Tamara, copied from the painting at Gelati,
and &ldquo;The Arrival of the Argonauts in Colchis,&rdquo; the figures
in which are all portraits, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>the Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich
being represented as Jason. There is also a very large collection of
photographs, comprising all that is worth seeing in the Caucasus and in
Persia. In the same block of buildings is the Public Library, in which
will be found most of the literature relating to the country, and a
fair number of books on general subjects.</p>
<p class="par">The library is at the corner of the Prospekt and
Baronovskaya Street, and turning down the latter, the first turning on
the right brings us to the Post Office, facing which is a girls&rsquo;
grammar school. The traveller who happens to pass that way when the
lessons for the day are over (and he might do worse if he likes to see
pretty young faces), will be surprised, unless he has been in Russia,
to see that all the children are dressed alike, regardless of age,
complexion, and taste; he will be still more surprised when he hears
that if one of these uniforms is seen out after 5 p.m., the fair wearer
is severely punished, it being the opinion of the Tsar&rsquo;s Minister
of Education that school-girls, and school-boys too, should after that
hour be at home preparing their tasks for next day. The school
accommodation is lamentably inadequate; in the government of Tiflis
there are only about 280 children at school for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>every
10,000 of the population, in the government of Kuta&iuml;s only
250.</p>
<p class="par">Returning to Golovinskii Prospekt, we pass on the right
the Staff Headquarters of the army of the Caucasus, the best restaurant
in the city, some good shops, and then arrive at the Aleksandrovskii
Garden, which slopes down to the river bank; its shady walks are
thronged every evening when a military band performs. Near its extreme
corner, and almost on the waterside, is the Russian theatre; although
the house is a small one and only used as a makeshift until the new
theatre is finished, it is a very pleasant place to spend an evening;
good companies from Petersburg and Moscow play during the season, and I
saw some of the stars of the profession there. Unfortunately, there is
a preference for translations of French and German pieces with which
the European is already familiar, but Russian plays are not totally
ignored. I once saw a version of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le Monde
o&ugrave; l&rsquo;on s&rsquo;ennuie</span>&rdquo; which was in the
smallest details of gesture and property a photographic reproduction of
the comedy as I have seen it on the classic boards of the <span lang=
"fr">Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</span>&mdash;but there was
one startling innovation, Bellac was described on the programme as an
<i>abb&eacute;</i> (sic!). The great charm <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>of the
Tifliskii Theatre is, however, its open air crush-room, a fine large
garden where a band plays between the acts, and where refreshments may
be partaken of and smoking indulged in.</p>
<p class="par">The new theatre on Golovinskii Prospekt is a handsome
edifice which was still unfinished at the time of my visit. The farther
you get from the Erivan Square the less aristocratic does the Boulevard
become, the only other building of note in that part of it being the
Cadets&rsquo; College; the opening of the new theatre will, however,
make a great difference, and in a few years the dirty little beershops
on the left will doubtless disappear, and Golovinskii Prospekt will be
one of the finest streets in the world. Its situation is a splendid
one, and is not unworthy of comparison with that of Princes&rsquo;
Street, Edinburgh; the Holy Mount, rising black and steep to a
considerable height, and adorned with the pretty white church of St.
David, might not inaptly be said to be to Tiflis what the Castle Hill
is to the modern Athens. At the end of the Boulevard is the
posting-station, whence we can return to our starting-place by
tram-car. All the main thoroughfares of the city are now laid with
tram-lines, the construction of which is due to a Belgian company which
is paying very good dividends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Thursday afternoon is the best time for visiting the
Church of St. David, for a service is then held and large numbers of
women attend. Proceeding from Salalaki along Laboratornaya, which is
parallel to the Boulevard and is the most select street in Tiflis, we
reach the street of the Holy Mount (Mtatsmindskaya), a steep,
roughly-paved thoroughfare which leads up to St. David&rsquo;s Place,
and a winding mountain path takes us thence to the church. St. David
was a Syrian monk who came to Georgia in the sixth century, and lived a
hermit&rsquo;s life among the woods which at that time covered the
hill. Tradition says that the daughter of a wealthy man who lived near
there, finding herself in an interesting condition, thought the best
way of getting out of the difficulty would be to accuse the saint of
being the cause of this state of affairs. The holy man, naturally,
objected, and having made his accuser appear in an assembly of the
people, he proved his innocence by making the unborn child say audibly
who was its father. Whereupon, in answer to the prayers of the saint,
the child was converted into a stone, which the damsel brought forth
immediately. This stone was made the foundation of a church. David then
asked that a spring of living water of fructifying virtue might be made
to flow; this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>fountain is still visible, and its water is
largely used by married ladies; the climb of twenty minutes from St.
David&rsquo;s Place is so toilsome that even the most bitter Malthusian
would hasten to quench his thirst there; as far as I know, it is the
only water in Tiflis fit for human consumption. Every pious lady who
visits the shrine carries a stone or brick up the hill with her, and it
is from these that the church was built and is still kept in repair.
There is another interesting custom in which maidens and matrons alike
take part; after adoring the picture of the Virgin, the suppliant
silently walks round the building three times, unwinding as she goes a
reel of thread, fit symbol of the boundlessness of her love and
veneration for the Immaculate Mother of God. Then picking up one of the
pebbles with which the ground is covered, she rubs it against the
plastered wall, and with beating heart waits to see if it will
stick&mdash;if it does, then her prayer has been heard, the lass will
have a sweetheart, the wife will have a son. The church is of modern
construction, but its design differs in no respect from the ancient
Byzantine style, specimens of which may be seen all over Georgia. The
interior is like that of any other Greek church, and on the walls there
are some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>quaint but rather crude pictures. The mass is, of
course, in Georgian, and the choral service strikes rather strangely on
Western ears, although not wanting in melody.</p>
<p class="par">Just below the church is a monument bearing the
inscription in Russian: &ldquo;Aleksandr Sergeyevich Griboyedov, born
January 4th, 1795, killed in Teheran, January 30th, 1829. Thy mind and
thy deeds will never die in the memory of Russia, but why did my love
outlive thee?&rdquo; The story of Griboyedov&rsquo;s life is a sad but
interesting one. By birth, education, and talents he was fitted to
become one of the most brilliant members of Russian society, but he was
early infected with the restless critical spirit of the century, and at
the age of seventeen he had already thought out the plot of his great
comedy <i lang="ru-latn">Gor&eacute; ot uma</i>, which is a bitter
satire on the fashionable life of his day. In 1812 his patriotism led
him to join in the national defence, but he never saw active service;
like his brother officers he enlivened the monotony of barrack life
with the wildest dissipation and folly; for instance, we read that he
galloped up two flights of stairs and into a ball-room, that he took
advantage of his position as organist in a Polish church, to strike up
a well-known comical tune in the midst of high <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>mass.
But he soon abandoned this unsatisfactory life, went to Petersburg in
1815, turned his attention to dramatic literature, and produced some
successful pieces. In 1818 we find him in Persia as secretary to the
embassy at Tavriz; there he led a solitary life and studied the Persian
language, he read all the poetical literature of the country, and
himself wrote Persian lyrics. In 1823 he took a year&rsquo;s leave of
absence, and employed much of the time in revising his great work; it
was his aim to make his verse &ldquo;as smooth as glass,&rdquo; and he
sometimes re-wrote a phrase a dozen times before it pleased him. When
it was at length finished, the severe censure prevented its
representation, and it was many years after the poet&rsquo;s death
before the full text of the play was heard in Russia. After taking part
in a war against the Caucasian Mountaineers, the Persian war gave him
an opportunity of exhibiting a bravery bordering on recklessness, and
when Erivan had been stormed it was through his skilful diplomacy that
Russia obtained such favourable terms of peace, although the British
Minister aided Persia with his counsels. In 1828 he left Petersburg
with the rank of ambassador at the Persian Court. Before leaving he
expressed to his friends the most gloomy forebodings, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>was sure
that he would not return to Russia alive. At Tiflis, however, he found
temporary relief from his mournful feelings in the society of Nina
Chavchavadze, daughter of Prince Alexander Chavchavadze, the poet, a
lady whom he described as a &ldquo;very Madonna of Murillo;&rdquo; he
married her, and she went with him as far as Tavriz, he promising to
come back to her as soon as possible. He had no sooner reached Teheran,
than his enemies at the court of the Shah began to excite popular
feeling against him, and an incident soon occurred which gave some
excuse for an attack on the embassy. An Armenian prisoner who had risen
to the dignity of chief eunuch in the Shah&rsquo;s household, and two
women, an Armenian and a German, from the harem of a powerful
personage, fled to the Russian ambassador and asked him to assist them
to return to Russian territory. Griboyedov insisted that, according to
the treaty of peace, all prisoners had a right to freedom, and he
refused to give up the refugees. On the 30th of January, 1829, a mad,
yelling crowd of 100,000 men made an attack on the embassy. Griboyedov,
sword in hand, led out his handful of horsemen and was immediately
killed; only one member of the embassy escaped death. It was
Griboyedov&rsquo;s wish that he should <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>be buried in Georgia, and
they chose this romantic spot which the poet had loved so much during
his stay in Tiflis. The beautiful Nina remained faithful to her
husband&rsquo;s memory, and mourned for him eight-and-twenty years,
until she was carried up the winding path to share his grave.</p>
<p class="par">The view from the churchyard is a splendid one; the
whole city, with its wonderful diversity of form and colour, lies at
your feet; on the right you can see far along the Kakhetian road, and
on the left the great highway to Vladikavkaz follows the winding course
of the Kura. In the evening we often climbed to the top of a bare crag
not far from the church, carrying with us a large earthenware flagon of
wine, a roast leg of mutton, fruit, cucumbers, and other delicacies,
and spreading out our cloaks on the ground lay there making merry,
singing and telling tales until long after midnight; the lights of the
town below us seemed like a reflection of the bright stars above us,
and the music and laughter of many a jovial group came up the hillside
to mingle with our own.</p>
<p class="par">After descending the hill, we cross the Boulevard at the
publishing office of <i lang="ru-latn">Kavkaz</i>, the official organ,
and skirting the Alexandrovskii <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Garden, soon reach the finest
bridge in the town, Vorontsovskii Most, from which we get an
interesting view of the waterside part of the Asiatic quarter; most of
the houses have balconies overhanging the river, and one is
involuntarily reminded of the Tiber banks at Rome. On the other side of
the bridge, in a small square, is a statue of Prince Vorontsov,
Governor of the Caucasus, from 1844 to 1854. During my stay the good
people of that district were astonished one morning to see the
Prince&rsquo;s head surmounted by a tall, well-worn sheepskin hat, such
as the Lesghians wear; the effect was exceedingly ridiculous, and the
youthful revellers who, at considerable risk of breaking their necks,
were the authors of the joke, were well rewarded for their pains by the
laughter of all who passed that way, for your Georgian is a merry
fellow.</p>
<p class="par">Turning to the right, we traverse Peski, a quarter very
different from Salalaki. Here we see small open-fronted Oriental shops
in which dark Persians ply their trades, making arms, saddlery,
jewellery, selling carpets, and doing a hundred other things all before
the eyes of men and in the open air. There is a strange confusion of
tongues and dresses; a smart little grammar-school girl rubs shoulders
with a veiled Mussulman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>woman, and occasionally you see the
uniform of a Russian officer elbowing his way through a crowd of
Lesghians, Armenians, Georgians, Persians; through the midst of all
this confusion runs the tram-car. We are not beyond all the influences
of civilization, for, besides the tram-way, we see on a sign-board the
legend &ldquo;Deiches Bir&rdquo; (? <span lang="de">Deutsches
Bier</span>), over the picture of a flowing tankard.</p>
<p class="par">We cross the narrow bridge and pay a visit to the baths.
Perhaps the reader knows something of the so-called Turkish bath, and
imagines that the baths of Tiflis are of the same sort? There is
certainly some similarity between the two, but there are profound
differences; the treatment to which the visitor is subjected at a
Turkish bath in Constantinople is not to be compared with what the
Persian shampooer puts you through in Tiflis. He goes through a whole
course of gymnastics with you, during which he jumps on your chest, on
the small of your back, doubles you up as if you were a fowl ready for
cooking, and, besides removing every particle of your epidermis,
performs sundry other experiments at which the novice stares aghast. At
the end of it all you make up your mind that it is not so terrible as
it looks, and as you feel wonderfully refreshed you resolve to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>return again before long. The water is of a heat
of about 100&deg; Fahr., and is impregnated with sulphur and other
substances which give it a healing virtue; it is to these springs that
Tiflis owes its existence, and they have always been of much importance
in the daily life of the people. Formerly it used to be the fashion for
ladies of rank to hire baths and dressing-rooms for a whole day,
spending the time in perfuming themselves, staining their finger tips,
dressing the hair, and performing a dozen other ceremonies of the
toilette, concluding with dinner, but the growth of European habits has
rendered this custom less common.</p>
<p class="par">The Cathedral of Sion is, as we said before, as old as
the city itself, but, of course, it has suffered considerably at the
hands of destroyers and restorers. Its style is the same as that of all
the other churches in Georgia, and it doubtless served as a pattern for
most of them. The inside has been tastefully decorated in modern times,
and produces a pleasing effect, although it seems small to anybody who
is familiar with the cathedrals of Europe. In front of the altar is the
Cross of St. Nina, formed of two vine branches bound together with the
saint&rsquo;s hair; this cross has always been the most sacred relic in
Georgia. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>There is also a modest tomb, which contains the
body of Prince Tsitsishvili, a Georgian who was appointed Governor of
the Caucasus by Alexander I., and who, after a glorious career, was
foully murdered outside the walls of Baku by the treacherous khan of
that city.</p>
<p class="par">From the cathedral the way to the European quarter leads
through the so-called Armenian Bazar, one of the most interesting parts
of the city. Old arms, coats of mail, helmets and shields, such as are
still used by the Khevsurs up in the mountains, silver ornaments and
many other interesting trifles, may be purchased here, but nothing of
great value is offered for sale, and the jewellery, with the exception
of filigree work from Akhaltsikhe (which is hard to get and very
expensive) is not very good. On the birthday of the Tsarevich, I was
walking down to the cathedral in order to be present at High Mass, when
I saw an incident thoroughly characteristic of the arbitrary
proceedings of the Russian police. A burly <i>gorodovoi</i>, clad in
white uniform and fully armed, was forcing the Asiatic shopkeepers in
the bazar to close their premises in order to do honour to the son of
the autocrat. I remembered how I had seen the Turkish soldiery in
Jerusalem perform a similar task a few months before, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>the
young Prince of Naples entered the Holy City; it is true that the Turks
went a step further than the Muscovites, for they drove the people out
into the main street, and refused to let them go home until the
evening, but the idea was the same in both cases. The best native
tailor of Tiflis lives in this neighbourhood, and I had the honour of
having a Circassian suit made for me by him; it fitted like a glove. I
may say that, although a great many people in Tiflis wear European
dress, in the country it is almost unknown. I found that for travelling
there is nothing better than the Circassian garb; it stands a great
deal of rough usage, and always looks respectable.</p>
<p class="par">Mushtaid is the finest promenade in the city. It is
situated at the west end, and is approached by the Mikhailovskaya, a
long, straight street, with fine gardens on either side of it. Some of
the best restaurants in the city are in these vine-shaded gardens, and
one of them is devoted to wrestling matches. It was my good fortune to
be present at a famous contest in which the Kakhetian champion,
Grdaneli, fought a certain bold Imeretian professor of the fancy art.
The performance was highly interesting, and it was gratifying to learn
from the bills that the proceeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30"
href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>were to be for the benefit of a
young man who wanted to study at Petersburg, but had not the necessary
means. The inner ring was formed of country gentlemen and officers, all
sitting cross-legged on the ground; behind them, tier above tier, were
at least a thousand spectators, breathless with expectation. A
primitive band, consisting of a drum and a <i>zurna</i> (an instrument
which sounds like the bagpipes), played a warlike air, to the sound of
which the heroes danced round the arena amid the frantic applause of
the crowd. Both men were fine fellows, but Grdaneli was a very
Hercules, and withal amiable-looking; he was the favourite, and
justified his reputation of being invincible by utterly demolishing the
Western man in a very short space of time. Every incident of the battle
called forth from the bystanders loud yells of praise and encouragement
which might have been heard miles off.</p>

<p class="par">The two best clubs have summer quarters in
Mikhailovskaya Street, by the waterside&mdash;the <i>Kruzhok</i> (near
the Vera Bridge) and the <i>Georgian Club</i> (nearer Vorontsovskii
Bridge); both have concert-rooms and gardens attached to them, and the
famous dance called <i>Lesginka</i> may be seen there with its
accompaniment of hand-clapping. The costumes worn by both sexes are
picturesque and rich, and one meets people of all nationalities
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>including political exiles from Poland, Russian
officers and officials, German professors and representatives of many
other races besides Georgians. All arms must be left at the entrance.
Georgian music is very unlike our own, and at first it strikes the
European as loud, wild, discordant, positively unpleasant, but when one
is accustomed to it, it is very agreeable. Before I had heard many of
the national melodies, I was very much astonished when an accomplished
lady told me that her reason for preferring the Georgian Club to the
Kruzhok was, that at the former Asiatic music was performed; but I can
now understand her liking for the music of her country. In the Appendix
I have written down a few melodies which will not, I think, grate
harshly on English ears.</p>
<p class="par">The beauty of the Georgian women has been called in
question by some travellers, but these are nearly all men whose
acquaintance with the people has been extremely limited. The favourite
observation of these critics is a stereotyped phrase about
&ldquo;undeniably good features, but want of animation.&rdquo; Surely
Alexandre Dumas the elder knew a beautiful face when he saw it; he
says: &ldquo;<i lang="fr">La Gr&egrave;ce, c&rsquo;est Galat&eacute;e
encore marbre; la G&eacute;orgie, c&rsquo;est Galat&eacute;e devenue
femme</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mushtaid, the town garden, owes nearly all its
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>charms to nature, the walks and open spaces are
neatly kept, but nearly the whole area is a forest in the recesses of
which we may lie undisturbed for hours, looking down on the turbid
waters of Kura and listening to the rustling of the leaves above and
around. Every evening its avenues are crowded with carriages and
horsemen; beautiful faces, tasteful toilettes, gay uniforms all combine
to form a charming picture. Fancy fairs are occasionally held, at which
the visitor may mingle with all the social celebrities, lose his money
in raffles, buy things he doesn&rsquo;t want&mdash;in short enjoy
himself just as if he were at home. But I doubt whether many
frequenters of bazaars in England have seen such an acrobatic feat as
was performed in Mushtaid last summer; an individual in tights hung
himself by the neck on the upper end of an inclined wire, stretched
over the heads of the spectators, and slid down it at lightning speed,
firing half a dozen pistol-shots as he went. No week passes without a
popular f&ecirc;te of some kind, for the Georgians are as fond of
gaiety as any nation in the world.</p>
<p class="par">From the above brief sketch the reader will see that
Tiflis is a city where one can live for a long time without suffering
from <i>ennui</i>. Although the immediate neighbourhood looks bare and
uninviting, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>there are, within a few miles, many beautiful
spots well worth a visit. The climate has been much abused by some
writers, and it must be admitted that during the months of July and
August the heat is very trying, but in my opinion Tiflis is a healthy
place; since the great plague of ninety years ago it has been pretty
free from epidemics, and although fever and dysentery kill a good many
people every year, the victims are nearly all residents of low-lying
parts of the city, where no European would live if he could help it.
During the warm weather there are often storms, characterized by all
the grandeur that might be expected in a region of great mountains so
near the tropics; after one of these the steep streets become foaming
torrents. The sheltered position of the city protects it from the
terrible gusts of wind which make the plain to the eastward almost
uninhabitable, and the storms seldom cause any more serious damage than
broken windows and flooded houses. Hitherto all the town water was
obtained from the Kura, and delivered to the consumer from
bullock-skins, but a well has now been dug a little below St.
David&rsquo;s, whence the dwellers on the right bank will get a supply
of a liquid which is not tepid, not opaque, not evil-smelling, and not
semi-solid. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=

<h2 class="main">THE GEORGIAN MILITARY ROAD BETWEEN TIFLIS AND
VLADIKAVKAZ.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The part which rivers have played in the history
of civilization is well illustrated by this road. The Aragva, flowing
southward from Gudaur, and the Terek, running northward from it, have
formed the highway along which countless crowds of Asiatics have
penetrated into Europe. Between the two streams there is a distance of
some ten miles, forming a huge but not insurmountable barrier, the
virtual removal of which did not take place until our own times. It was
General Yermolov who, in 1824, succeeded in making the road practicable
for troops of all kinds; but from the poet Puskhin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Journey to Erzerum&rdquo; (1829), we learn that there was still
room for improvement. The traveller had to go with a convoy of 500
soldiers and a cannon, he dare not lag behind for fear of the
mountaineers, provisions and lodgings were scarce and bad, the roads
were impassable for carriages, the rate of speed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>was
sometimes only ten miles a day. When we read Pushkin&rsquo;s account,
and the one given by Lermontov, in &ldquo;A Hero of Our Times,&rdquo;
we can only ask ourselves, &ldquo;What was the road like before
Yermolov?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">During the wars with Kasi-mullah and Shamil, it became
indispensable to effect great improvements, and, at length, about
five-and-twenty years ago, under the governorship of Prince
Bariatinskii, the road was finished, and is now one of the finest in
the world, besides being one of the highest&mdash;the Simplon is only
6147 feet above sea-level, while the Dariel road is nearly 2000 feet
higher. The total distance from Tiflis to Vladikavkaz is 126 miles, and
the distance can be done comfortably in less than twenty hours. During
the summer 1150 horses are kept in readiness at the stations, in the
winter the number is reduced by about 300. Two stage coaches start from
each end every day, but as they run during the night also, much of the
beauty of the scenery is lost by those who avail themselves of this
mode of conveyance; besides, it is difficult to get an outside seat
unless you book it a long time in advance. It is far better to travel
by <i>tro&iuml;ka</i>, as you are then free to stop when you like and
as long as you like, and you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>get an uninterrupted view of the
country through which you pass.</p>
<p class="par">About the middle of June, having previously obtained a
formidable-looking document by which Alexander Alexandrovich, Autocrat
of all the Russias, commanded all postmasters to supply me with horses
immediately on demand, I set out on my journey over the frosty
Caucasus, accompanied by a young Russian friend. The <i>tro&iuml;ka</i>
had been ordered for four a.m., but, of course, it did not turn up till
half-past five. For the information of those who have never been in
Russia, I may say that a <i>tro&iuml;ka</i> is a team of three horses
harnessed abreast in a vehicle of unique construction called a
<i>teliezhka</i>. The form of the cart is like a longitudinal section
of a beer barrel; it is large enough to contain an ordinary travelling
trunk; it is of wood, has neither sides nor springs, and there are four
wheels; the seat is made by slipping a piece of rope through a couple
of rings on either side, and laying your cloak and a pillow on the
rope; the driver sits on the front edge of the cart; the whole affair
is invariably in the last stage of decay. The shafts are so long that
the horses cannot kick the bottom out of the thing, and the horse in
the centre has his head swung up in a wooden frame. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>The
driver is always asleep or drunk, or both, but he never lets the reins
fall, and at regular intervals mechanically applies the whip to his
steeds; he only wakes up when there is a shaky bridge to cross, and,
regardless of the notice &ldquo;Walking pace!&rdquo;, first crosses
himself and commends his soul to the saints, then gallops over the
creaking structure at racing speed.</p>
<p class="par">As we clattered down the steep rocky streets which lead
to the Boulevard, I had not much time to look round; all my attention
was necessary to preserve myself from falling out of the cart, the
jolting was terrible. However, by the time we had got to the outskirts
of the town the road became much smoother; the driver got down and
released the clappers of the bells above the middle horse&rsquo;s head,
and we rattled along merrily to the tune of eight miles an hour. Just
outside the city an imposing cruciform monument marks the spot where
the late Tsar&rsquo;s carriage was overturned without injuring his
Majesty. Passing the Sakartvelo Gardens, where the good people of
Tiflis often dine in vine-covered bowers by the river-side, we cross
the Vera, an important tributary of the Kura, and then enter a broad
plain which continues for many miles to the westward. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the other side of the Kura we see Mushtaid; a little
farther on is the pretty German colony of Alexandersdorf, with its
poplar avenues, neat houses, and modest little white church. All the
German colonies in the Caucasus seem to be exactly alike, and they do
not in any respect differ from German villages in the fatherland; the
colonists altogether ignore the people of the country in which they
have settled, and, although they make a comfortable livelihood, their
isolated condition and the absence of all European influence must make
their lives very narrow and joyless. Some of these colonies were
founded in order to set before the native peasantry examples of good
agriculture and farm management, but this worthy object has not been
attained, and the Teutons are looked upon with feelings generally of
indifference, sometimes of positive ill-will. High on the hills behind
the colony stands the white monastery of St. Antony, a favourite place
for picnics. In the cliffs on the left of our road are numerous holes,
variously conjectured to be troglodyte dwellings (like those at Uphlis
Tsikhe), rock tombs, places of refuge in time of war, provision stores,
&amp;c. Before us we see the road winding up between the hills in a
northerly direction, and after crossing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>the Transcaucasian
railway and then the Kura we arrive at the post-house of Mtzkhet, not
far from the village of that name.</p>
<p class="par">Mtzkhet, if we are to believe local traditions, is one
of the oldest cities on earth, for the story goes that it was founded
by a great-grandson of the patriarch Noah. Be that as it may, there are
unmistakable signs that a Greek or Roman town existed here at a remote
date, and antiquaries generally agree in identifying Mtzkhet with the
Acrostopolis of the Romans, the headquarters of Pompey after he had
defeated Mithridates and subdued Iberia and Albania. No better spot
could have been chosen, for its position at the junction of the Aragva
and the Kura commands the two great roads of the country and makes it
the key of Transcaucasia. Mtzkhet, the ancient capital of Georgia, was
always a place of much importance in the annals of the kingdom; now it
is a wretched village of some hundreds of inhabitants. It was here that
St. Nina began her work of converting the nation, and we propose to
give a brief account of the legends relating to this event.</p>
<p class="par">Tradition says that at the beginning of our era there
lived in Mtzkhet a wealthy Jew named Eleazar, who frequently made
journeys to Jerusalem on business. On the occasion of one of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>these visits he became possessed of the tunic of
our Lord, which he brought home with him as a present to his daughter.
She, expecting a valuable gift, ran out to meet him, and with an angry
expression snatched from his hands the precious relic, of which she
little knew the worth; she fell dead on the spot, but no force could
take the garment from her hands, so it was buried with her, and from
her grave there soon grew up a tall cedar, from the bark of which oozed
a fragrant myrrh, which healed the sick. Now about three centuries
later, that is in the third century of our era, St. Nina was born in
Cappadocia. When she was twelve years of age her parents proceeded to
Jerusalem, and gave themselves up to religious work, leaving the maiden
under the care of a devout old woman, who taught her to read the
Scriptures. Nina was very anxious to learn what had become of
Christ&rsquo;s tunic, and said to her teacher, &ldquo;Tell me, I pray
thee, where is that earthly purple of the Son of God now kept?&rdquo;
To which the venerable matron replied that it had been taken to a
heathen land called Iveria, far away to the northward, and that it lay
buried there in the city of Mtzkhet. One night the Blessed Virgin
appeared to the damsel in a dream, and said to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>her,
&ldquo;Go to the Iverian land, preach the Gospel of the Lord Jesus, and
He will reward thee. I will be thy guard and guide,&rdquo; and with
these words she handed to her a cross made of vine branches. When Nina
awoke and saw in her hands the wondrous cross she wept for joy, and
after reverently kissing the holy gift she bound the two loose sticks
together with her own long hair. This cross has always been the
palladium of Georgia, and is still preserved in the Sion Cathedral at
Tiflis. Now it so happened that at this time seven-and-thirty maidens,
fleeing from the persecutions of Diocletian, left Jerusalem to spread
the good tidings in Armenia; St. Nina went with them as far as
Vashgarabada, and then pursued her journey alone. As she was entering
the city of Mtzkhet, the king of Georgia, Marian, with all his people,
went out to a hill in the neighbourhood to offer human sacrifices to
idols, but in answer to her prayer a mighty storm arose and destroyed
the images. She took up her abode in a cell in the king&rsquo;s garden,
and soon became well-known as a healer of the sick. At length the queen
fell ill, and St. Nina, having made her whole in the name of Jesus,
converted the Georgian court to Christianity, and in 314 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> baptized all the people of the city. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>Over the
spot in the royal garden where her cell had been, the king built the
Samtavr church, which still exists, and lies to the left of the
post-road. It was then revealed to St. Nina that the tunic, the object
of her search, lay buried under a cedar in the middle of the town; the
tree was cut down and the robe was found in the hands of the dead girl.
On the spot where the cedar stood King Marian built, in 328, the
Cathedral of the Twelve Apostles; the cedar was replaced by a column,
and this column is said to drip myrrh occasionally, even in these
degenerate days of ours. The sacred garment was preserved in the
cathedral until the seventeenth century, when Shah Abbas sent it as a
present to the Tsar of Russia, Mikhail Fedorovich. It was solemnly
deposited in the Cathedral of the Assumption at Moscow, where I saw it
last autumn.</p>
<p class="par">Having evangelized Kartli, St. Nina proceeded to
Kakheti, where she met with the same success, and died at Bodb&eacute;,
near Signakh; her tomb is in a monastery overlooking one of the finest
landscapes in all Kakheti.</p>
<p class="par">The Cathedral of the Twelve Apostles is the chief place
of interest in Mtzkhet. The original church was of wood, but in 378 it
was replaced by a stone edifice, which stood until the invasion
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>of Tamerlane. The existing church was built in the
fifteenth century. A stone wall, with ruined towers, encloses a
rectangular piece of ground, in which stands the cathedral, a fine
building about seventy paces long by twenty-five paces broad. It is in
the Byzantine style, and the interior is divided into three parts by
two rows of columns. Here lie buried the last kings of Georgia and
their families, the patriarchs of the church, and other illustrious
persons.</p>
<p class="par">The post-house at Mtzkhet was a pleasant surprise to me,
but I found nearly all the stations on this road equally comfortable;
in many of them there are bed-rooms, a dining-room, a ladies&rsquo;
room, and one can get white bread and European food. Those who have
travelled on post-roads in Russia will readily understand my
surprise.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving Mtzkhet, our road follows the Aragva along a
smooth valley between forest-clad hills; the scenery reminded me very
much of some of the dales of Thelemarken in Norway. The soil is rich
and well cultivated, and here, as elsewhere, we saw a whole herd of
oxen dragging one wooden plough. This valley is one of the most
feverish places on the whole road, and the people attribute this to a
yellow weed (<i>Carlina arcaulis</i>), of which there is a great
abundance; strange to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44"
name="pb44">44</a>]</span>say, other places where the plant flourishes
have the same unpleasant reputation for unhealthiness, the explanation
is doubtless to be found in the fact that this weed grows best in a
damp soil.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Tsilkani</i> is the next station, but there is no
village there. While waiting for horses we saw in the yard a camel;
there are plenty of these amiable animals in Tiflis, but I did not
think they went so far north as the Aragva.</p>
<p class="par">The scenery continues to be of the same character as far
as the station of <i>Dushet</i>, some distance from the garrison-town
of that name, which lies in rectangular regularity on the hillside,
like a relief map; it is a place of some military importance on account
of its position at the entrance of the narrow part of the valley, but
it is as uninteresting as any Russian provincial town. Near it is a
lake, said to cover a Caucasian Sodom; the traveller looks at the lake
with more attention than he would bestow upon it if it were in
Switzerland, for lakes, like waterfalls, are very rare in the Caucasus.
Soon after leaving Dushet we climb a rather steep hill&mdash;the wilder
part of the road is about to begin. On our left is a huge,
antique-looking edifice with towers and battlements, which we feel sure
has a romantic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>history, but we are disappointed to learn that the
place is only a modern imitation. At a pretty spot on the river-bank
near here I met on my return a party of about fifty prisoners on their
way to Siberia; they were, as a rule, honest enough looking fellows,
and I could not help feeling pity for them when I remembered how many
cases I knew of in which innocent men had been ruined in mind and body,
by exile for crimes with which they had no connection. The road crosses
a range of green hills, and passing through scenery very like that of
Kakheti, descends to the Aragva again at Ananur, the most picturesque
village on the whole road, although the surrounding landscape is tame
compared with that to the northward.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Ananur</i> lies in a pretty little valley, amid
well-wooded hills. At the southern end of the village, perched on a
rising ground, is a partly ruined wall with towers and battlements,
within which are two churches, one of them still used for divine
service, the other a mouldering heap of moss-grown stones. The
post-house is at the farther end of the village, and while the horses
are being changed we have time to return to the ruins, about a quarter
of an hour&rsquo;s walk; by the roadside are several little shops in
which furs of all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>the wild animals of the country may be bought
for a trifle; there is also a small barrack. We now climb up to the
citadel, and as we enter we cannot help thinking of some of the scenes
of blood which have taken place here, even as late as a century and a
half ago, when Giorgi, the Eristav (or headman) of Aragva, defended the
castle against the Eristav of Ksan. When the place had been taken and
all the garrison slain, Giorgi and his family fled to the old church,
thinking that no Christian would violate the right of sanctuary, but
the conqueror heaped up brushwood round the building and burnt it down;
only one of the ill-fated family escaped alive.</p>
<p class="par">The door by which we are admitted lies on the side
farthest removed from the road; it leads us through a square tower into
the citadel proper, which occupied a piece of ground about one hundred
paces long and forty paces broad; formerly it used to stretch down to
the very bank of the river, where a ruined tower may still be seen. On
entering we see immediately on the left the ruined house of the Eristav
Giorgi; straight in front of us is a well-preserved tower, on the left
of which may be seen the ruins of the old church, on the right is the
modern church. The old church is, of course, quite ruined; it is only
about five-and-twenty <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>paces in length by fifteen paces broad. There
still exist fragments of painting and carving which would doubtless
prove highly interesting to those who are acquainted with the history
of Byzantine art. The building is said to date from the fourth century.
There is also a small underground chapel which is fairly well
preserved.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

<p class="par first">Page 46.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The larger church was built by the Eristav Giorgi in
1704; it is thirty paces long by twenty paces broad, and is an enlarged
copy of the older sanctuary; the stone of which it is built is
yellowish. It is a very fine specimen of Georgian architecture.
Beautifully carved in the stone, on each side of the building, is a
gigantic cross of vine branches (the cross of St. Nina). The decorative
work is excellent throughout, both in design and workmanship; but the
figures of animals, &amp;c., are very poor indeed.</p>
<p class="par">Ananur is connected with the darkest page in the
mournful latter-day history of Georgia. The Persians had taken Tiflis
in 1795, and reduced it to a smouldering heap of ruins. King Irakli,
with a few servants, had escaped almost by a miracle, and had taken
refuge in the mountain fastness of Ananur; abandoned by his cowardly,
faithless children, betrayed by his most trusted dependents
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>and allies, sick in body and weary in mind, the
old man of seventy-seven was a sight sad enough to make angels weep.
&ldquo;In the old, half ruined monastery of Ananur, in an ancient cell
which used to stand in the corner of the monks&rsquo; orchard, one
<span class="corr" id="xd21e940" title="Source: have might">might
have</span> seen a man dressed in a rough sheepskin cloak, sitting with
his face turned to the wall. That man, once the thunderbolt of all
Transcaucasia, was the king of Georgia, Irakli II. Near him stood an
old Armenian servant. &lsquo;Who is that sitting in the corner?&rsquo;
asked those who passed by. &lsquo;He whom thou seest,&rsquo; replied
the Armenian, with a sigh, &lsquo;was once a man of might, and his name
was honoured throughout Asia. His people never had a better ruler. He
strove for their welfare like a father, and for forty years kept his
empire together; but old age has weakened him, and has brought
everything to ruin. In order to prevent quarrels after his death, he
determined to divide his kingdom among his children while he still
lived, but his hopes in them were deceived. He who was chief eunuch of
Tamas Khuli Khan when Irakli was a leader of the Persian army, now
marched against him in his feeble old age. His own children refused to
help him and their native land, for there were many of them, and each
thought he would be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>striving, not for himself, but for his
brother&rsquo;s good. The King of Georgia had to ask the help of the
King of Imereti, but if thou hadst been in Tiflis thou hadst seen how
shamefully the Imeretians behaved. Irakli, with but a handful of men,
fought gallantly against a hundred thousand, and lost his throne only
because his children pitilessly forsook him, leaving him to be defeated
by a wretched gelding. His ancient glory is darkened, his capital in
ruins, the weal of his folk is fled. Under yon crumbling wall thou
seest the mighty King of Georgia hiding from the gaze of all men,
helpless and clothed in a ragged sheepskin! His courtiers, all those
who have eaten his bread and been pressed to his bosom, have left him;
not one of them has followed his master, excepting only me&mdash;a
poor, despised Armenian.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">From Ananur the road rises along the Aragva valley,
which is well cultivated, thanks to a fine system of artificial
irrigation. On our left, about a couple of versts from the station, we
see high up on a hill the ruined castle and church of Sheupoval, where
a grandson of the Eristav Giorgi shared the fate of the rest of his
family; the place was burnt down with all its inhabitants. As we pass
along the road we meet several pleasant-looking wayfarers, all armed
with long, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>wide dagger, and many carrying in addition sword
and rifle; this highway is, however, perfectly safe as far as brigands
are concerned, the carrying of weapons is merely a custom which means
little more than the use of a walking-stick in our country. Several
handsome Ossets, as they pass, courteously salute us with the phrase,
&ldquo;May your path be smooth!&rdquo; a peculiarly appropriate wish in
such a region. When we go through a little village, pretty children run
out to look at us, but they never beg, indeed I never saw or heard of a
Georgian beggar, although there is much poverty among the people.</p>
<p class="par">All along the road, wherever there is a coign of vantage
one sees it topped by the ruins of a four-sided tapering tower,
standing in the corner of a square enclosure; every foot of ground has
its history of bloodshed and bravery, a history now long forgotten,
save for the dim traditions of the peasantry.</p>
<p class="par">The stage between Ananur and Pasanaur (21 versts), is
the longest on the whole road, and, although it presents no engineering
difficulties such as those which were met with farther to the
northward, it is, nevertheless, a toilsome journey for the horses, as
it rises about 1300 feet. I shall never forget the pleasant emotions I
felt <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>on making the night journey from Pasanaur to
Ananur; although there was no moon, the stars shone with a brightness
that is unknown in northern latitudes, and lighted up the strange,
beautiful landscape; the glittering snow-peaks behind, the silvery
stream at our side, the green forests and the lonely ruins made up a
picture of surpassing loveliness and weirdness. Fort Gudomakarsk is
soon visible, and we know that the station is not far off. I may as
well say that almost all the so-called forts between Tiflis and
Vladikavkaz are insignificant, neglected-looking places, merely small
barracks; they formerly served to keep the mountaineers in order, but
now there is really very little necessity for maintaining a garrison in
them.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Pasanaur</i> (which in old Persian means &ldquo;Holy
Hill&rdquo;) is situated in a very narrow part of the valley, amid
thick woods. The station is a pretty one, and, like that at Ananur, so
comfortable that the traveller who has to spend a night there need not
be pitied. The only building of interest in the village is a modern
church in the Russian style of architecture, which looks as if it had
been painted with laundry blue; for ugliness it can compare with any
church in Muscovy.</p>
<p class="par">To the eastward of Pasanaur live the Khevsurs,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>Pshavs and Tushes, peoples probably having a
common origin, and speaking a language akin to Georgian. Their number
is variously estimated, from twenty to thirty thousand. They live in a
very primitive way, and the Khevsurs still clothe themselves in chain
armour and helmets; this circumstance, added to the fact that they have
long been Christians, has given rise to the supposition that they are
descended from a party of Crusaders who lost their way in trying to
return to Europe overland, and settled in these valleys. Their country
is among the wildest in the whole range, and their villages are perched
high up among the rocks, like eagles&rsquo; nests. The Khevsurs live
chiefly on the scanty products of agriculture; the Pshavs and Tushes
are pastoral peoples, in winter they drive their flocks down into
Kakheti, and when the snow among the mountains begins to melt they
return to their native valleys. All these tribes are wild and brave to
the highest degree; from the earliest times they have formed part of
the Georgian kingdom, and have distinguished themselves in many a
battle against the infidel. The Christianity of this region is not so
elaborate as that of Rome or Byzantium, but I suppose it is quite as
reasonable as that of the Russian <i lang="ru-latn">muzhik</i> or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>the English farm-labourer; they have made a saint
of Queen Tamara, and they worship the god of war and several other
deities in addition to the God Christ. Irakli II. tried to reform their
theology, but they replied, &ldquo;If we, with our present worship, are
firm in our obedience and loyalty to the king, what more does he ask of
us?&rdquo; There are now many Orthodox Greek Churches in the villages,
but the people totally ignore their existence.</p>
<p class="par">After leaving Pasanaur the road bends to the westward,
leaving on the right a high table-shaped mountain of granite which has
for a long time seemed to bar our progress; we still keep close to the
Aragva, and the scenery becomes bolder, and the soil more barren; here
and there we see high up on the face of the rock a cluster of Osset
houses; from the valley they look like small dark holes in the cliffs.
Pushkin has described them as &ldquo;swallows&rsquo; nests,&rdquo; and
no happier name could have been chosen.</p>
<p class="par">The Ossets call themselves Ir or Iran, the Tatars and
Georgians call them Oss or Ossi. According to official accounts they
number over 100,000, about half of them being on each side of the
Caucasus. The majority of them profess the Christian religion, but
15,000 are Mahometans, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>and a considerable number are idolaters.
Their traditions say that they came from Asia across the Ural, and used
at one time to dwell in the plain to the north of the Caucasus, but
were gradually driven into the mountains by stronger peoples. In the
reign of Queen Tamara most of them embraced Christianity, and
Tamara&rsquo;s second husband was an Osset; they remained tributary to
Georgia until the beginning of the present century, and a traveller who
visited Tiflis about a hundred years ago says that Irakli&rsquo;s
bodyguard was composed of Ossets &ldquo;who never washed.&rdquo; The
Ossets were the first Caucasian people to settle down quietly to
Russian rule, and they have never given any serious trouble, if we
except their share in the Imeretian rising of 1810. The stories about
the Ossets being a Teutonic people are as absurd as the assertion that
there are in the Crimea Northmen who speak Dutch. They live in a
wretched manner, in houses built of loose stones, without mortar; but
their physique is good, and their faces are handsome and engaging.</p>
<p class="par">After another long climb of 1300 feet we reach
<i>Mleti</i>. Here, indeed, we have come to the end of the
valley&mdash;we are at the bottom of a deep well with sides as bare and
steep as walls, on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55"
name="pb55">55</a>]</span>top glitters the everlasting snow. The
engineering difficulties which we have hitherto encountered are as
nothing compared with those before us. To our right rises a precipice
over three thousand feet high, up which the road climbs in a series of
zigzags.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after leaving Mleti we saw the sun set behind the
silvery peaks to the west, and within half an hour it was dark; our
driver was drunk and fast asleep, and we had occasionally to seize the
reins in order to keep the horses from going too near the fenceless
edge of the abyss. The distance to Gudaur is only fourteen and a half
versts, but nearly the whole ascent has to be done at walking pace;
slowly we rose up the hillside, gazing silently now up at the
glistening chain above us, now down into the gloomy valley behind us,
where a fleecy waterfall shone in the starlight; we saw no wayfarers
all the time, and no sound came to break the stillness of the summer
night.</p>
<p class="par">At last we reached the tableland at the top, and were
soon in the station-house of <i>Gudaur</i>, almost 8000 feet above
sea-level. Although there were only patches of snow here and there on
the ground near us, the air was very cool; only a few days ago we had
been simmering in Tiflis in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>heat of over 100&deg; Fahr., and now
we saw the thermometer down at freezing-point. I knew that as far as
comfort went Mleti was a much better place than Gudaur to spend the
night at, but I was eager to enjoy the delightful intoxication of the
mountain air as soon and as long as possible, and I did enjoy it
thoroughly.</p>
<p class="par">After a very rough and hasty supper and a short walk on
the edge of the plateau, we entered the common room, and wrapping
ourselves up in our <i>burkas</i>, sought out the softest plank on the
floor, and were soon sleeping the sleep of innocence. Several
travellers arrived during the night, for when we rose at dawn we found
the room full. Leaving our companions to snore in peace, we ordered the
horses, and were soon on our way to the pass.</p>
<p class="par">On the grassy plain were feeding large flocks of goats
and sheep, the latter with strange, large, fatty protuberances on
either side of the tail. To the right is a remarkable-looking green
hill of pyramidal shape, and beyond it an old castle looks down from an
inaccessible crag. The scenery of the pass itself is imposing, but it
is seen to better advantage when one comes in the opposite direction,
i.e. from Vladikavkaz to Tiflis; in that case one leaves a scene of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>wildest desolation for the luxuriant beauty of the
Aragva valley and Kartli; on the northward journey it is, of course,
the reverse. The road sinks very rapidly to a depth of almost 2000
feet; the long snow-sheds remind us that even at the present day a
winter journey over the Cross Mountain is a serious undertaking;
traffic is often stopped for several days at a time by avalanches, and
in spring the rivers sometimes wash away the bridges and large pieces
of the road. At the foot of the mountain we meet the foaming Terek, a
river almost as muddy as the Kura, and following its course reach a
vast plain, on the east side of which stands Kobi.</p>
<p class="par">Near <i>Kobi</i> station there are two villages; the
larger of the two lies under the shadow of a perpendicular rock on the
one side, on the other side it is flanked by a rugged crag, on the top
of which may be seen the ruins of a church and a castle. By the
roadside are curious monumental tablets, painted with hieroglyphs of
various kinds, among which the rising sun generally occupies the chief
place. All round Kobi there are numerous medicinal springs of all
kinds, and the station-house is intended to accommodate a few patients.
There may come a day when Kobi will be as fashionable as Kissingen, but
in the meantime it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span>is not the sort of place that one would
recommend to an invalid.</p>
<p class="par">On the score of originality nothing can be said against
the environs of Kobi; when we looked round we could not help thinking
of the phrase &ldquo;riddlings of creation,&rdquo; which we have heard
applied to the Scottish Highlands; it does, indeed, look as if some of
the materials left over after the creation of our earth, had been left
here in disordered heaps, to give us some idea of chaos. The road now
follows the course of the Terek, and the scenery is indescribably
grand; straight before us lies snowy Kazbek in all its rugged wildness,
here and there are ruined towers, and about the middle of the stage a
turn in the road brings us to an <i>aul</i>, or village, of
medi&aelig;val appearance, by the side of which is a little copse, a
rarity in this bleak district. The basaltic rocks present many
fantastic shapes and colours to the eye; in several places I saw what
looked like huge bundles of rods, reminding me of the Giant&rsquo;s
Causeway. Before reaching the station we were met by children who
offered for sale all sorts of crystals, pieces of quartz and other
pretty geological specimens.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kazbek</i> station is a very comfortable inn, where
one can dine well, and is to be recommended as a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>place
for a prolonged stay. The mountain, generally called Kazbek, rises from
the valley in one almost unbroken mass, reaching a height of 16,550
feet above sea-level; the Georgians call it Mkhinvari (ice mountain),
and the Ossets, Christ&rsquo;s Peak; Kazbek is really the name of the
family who own this part of the country, and is wrongly applied to the
mountain. This peak, like Ararat, enjoys the reputation of being
inaccessible, and our countrymen, Freshfield, Moore, and Tucker, who
climbed to the top, without much difficulty, in June, 1868, were not
believed when they told the story of their ascent. On the mountain the
sportsman can occasionally get a shot at a <i>tur</i> (aurochs,
<i>&AElig;goceros Pallasii</i>); but if he is unwilling to expose
himself to the necessary danger and fatigue, he can for a few roubles
buy a pair of horns at the station.</p>
<p class="par">Those who invade the realm of the mountain spirit should
not fail to visit Devdorak glacier, the easiest way of making the
ascent; there they will see a place where the native hunters make
sacrifices of <i>tur</i> horns to propitiate the spirit, who might
otherwise throw blocks of ice down on their heads.</p>
<p class="par">There is a popular legend to the effect that on the
summit of Mkhinvari is the tent of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>Patriarch Abraham, within
which, in a cradle held up by an unseen hand, lies the child Jesus
asleep; outside there grows some wheat of wonderful size, beside the
tree of life; round the cradle are heaps of treasures. Under the reign
of King Irakli II., a priest and his son started for the summit in
order to see these wonders; the boy returned alone, bearing samples of
the material of the tent, some big grains of wheat, &amp;c., the soles
of his boots were covered with silver coins which had stuck to
them&mdash;unfortunately it was found that the coins were quite
modern!</p>
<p class="par">As is well known, Mkhinvari is generally identified with
the story of Prometheus, although the mountain does not correspond with
the description given by &AElig;schylus. Early travellers even went so
far as to assert that they had seen the very chains with which the hero
was bound, and there is a local legend to the effect that a giant still
lies there in fetters. When I approached the mountain from Kobi I could
not help being reminded of Prometheus. I saw a gigantic black space of
irregular form with snow all round it; an imaginative mind found in
this irregular tract a considerable resemblance to the human shape.</p>
<p class="par">No traveller should leave Kazbek without making a
pilgrimage to the monastery of St. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>Stephen, which stands on the top
of an isolated hill about 2000 feet above the station. At sunset the
view is wonderfully beautiful. Tradition says that the monastery was
built by three kings, but does not give their names; in any case the
building is of considerable antiquity. Service is held in the church
three times a year. The interior has been spoiled by that fiend the
&ldquo;restorer.&rdquo; From the church you look over a wide,
uninhabited valley to the giant mountain, and on turning round you see
the river Terek, on the banks of which are the station and village; on
either hand stretch dark cavernous-looking valleys. Beyond the Terek is
the home of the Ingushes, a people who frequently carry off the cattle
of their more settled neighbours, and give the small garrison of Kazbek
some amusement in hunting them down.</p>
<p class="par">After leaving Kazbek, we see on our right the
manor-house of the princely family from which the place takes its name,
a family which has produced, and doubtless will yet produce, sons which
will be an honour to Georgia; the house is a fine two-storey edifice,
and there is a pretty chapel attached to it. In a few minutes we reach
the Mad Ravine, so called from a torrent of terrible impetuosity, which
has formed one of the most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href=
"#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>serious obstacles to the construction
of the road. We now enter Dariel, the pass from which the road takes
its name, one of the grandest spots on earth.</p>
<p class="par">According to philologists, Dariel is derived from an old
Persian word meaning gate (cf. Der-bend, Thuer, door, Slav Dver,
&amp;c.), and in fact it was here that the ancient geographers placed
the site of the famous Caucasian Gates; but surely there is something
to be said in favour of the local tradition which connects the place
with Darius I. of Persia. As for the gates, it is, of course,
impossible to say definitely whether they ever existed or not, at all
events there are several points where it would not have been very
difficult to construct them.</p>

<p class="figureHead">DARIEL FORT AND RUINS OF TAMARA&rsquo;S
CASTLE.</p>
<p class="par first">Page 62.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At the entrance of the ravine, on the left bank of the
Terek, stands a high rock, on which may be seen the ruins of a castle,
said to have been founded in 150 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, but
doubtless having a still longer history. This castle is always
associated with the name of a certain wicked Queen Tamara, a mythical
creation of the popular fancy, and Lermontov has written a very pretty
poem based on the legend. It is said that this Tamara (not to be
confounded with the good Tamara), was very beautiful, and that she used
to invite all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>handsome young men who passed that way to
come up and live with her, promising them all the delights that heart
could wish for; after one night of bliss the unfortunate gentleman was
deprived of his head, and was then thrown down into the Terek, which
bore away his body. If the legend is not wrong in saying that the river
carried away the corpses, the frolicsome monarch must have been
comparatively constant during the summer months, or else the pile of
wantons would soon have become large enough to frighten all the passion
out of intending visitors, for in the month of June, Terek would not
float a respectably-sized cat.</p>
<p class="par">By the road-side is Dariel Fort, a romantic-looking
place with old-fashioned battlemented towers; a few Kazaks are
quartered here, and must find the time hang very heavily on their
hands. When you reach this fort it looks as if it were impossible to go
beyond it, a mighty wall stretches right across the path; but the road
follows the course of the river, indeed it is built in the river-bed,
and winds along between awful cliffs whose summits are lost in the
clouds, and whose flanks are seldom or never touched by a ray of
sunlight. We sometimes hear of places where a handful of men could keep
back an army, this is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64"
name="pb64">64</a>]</span>one of them; a touch would send down upon the
road some of the heavy, overhanging masses of rock, and effectually
close the pass. About fifty years ago an avalanche fell here, from the
glacier of Devdorak, and it was two years before the rubbish was all
cleared away. When the new road is blocked by snow or carried away by
floods, the old road, high up near the snow-line, has to be used.</p>
<p class="par">The scenery of this pass has been described by Pushkin,
Lermontov, and many others, but it is one of the few places that do not
disappoint the traveller, however much he may have expected. It must
not be forgotten that the road through this narrow gorge is the only
passable one that crosses the Caucasian range; there are, it is true,
one or two other tracks, but they are not practicable for wheeled
carriages.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In the most gloomy part of the defile the road crosses
by a bridge to the left bank of the Terek, and a few versts farther on
we emerge into comparatively open ground at <i>Lars</i>. I had, as
usual, given my <i>podorozhnaia</i> (road-pass) to a stable-boy, with a
request to get the horses ready without delay, and was sitting drinking
tea, when I was astonished to hear behind me the long unfamiliar tones
of my native language; I was still more <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>surprised when I saw that
the speaker was the <i>starosta</i>, or superintendent of the station
(the Government inspector, or <i>smatritel</i>, is the real chief). He
told me that he had seen from my pass that I was English, and had taken
the liberty to come and have a chat with me. He spoke English fluently,
and has spent five years in London, has travelled in the United States,
and is altogether a very pleasant fellow; he had only been at Lars a
year and a half, and during all that time had not seen an Englishman.
We parted very good friends, expecting to meet again when I returned
from Vladikavkaz.</p>
<p class="par">The village of Lars, north of the post-house, is
inhabited, among others, by some of the Tagaur Ossets, descended from
Tagaur, an individual who at a remote period was heir to the Armenian
throne, and fled to the mountains for fear of his younger brothers.
Their royal descent leads them to think themselves superior to the poor
folk among whom they dwell, and they are cordially disliked by the
latter. Just outside the village is one of the towers which are so
common all along the road; it doubtless yielded a handsome revenue to
its owner in the good old days when every traveller had to pay a heavy
toll for the privilege of passing one of these fortresses. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We still keep close to the Terek, which comes rushing
down from Dariel with a fall of one foot in every thirty. Pushkin,
comparing the Terek with Imatra, in Finland, unhesitatingly declares
the superiority of the former in grandeur. Of course the surrounding
scenery in the two cases is quite different, but as far as the rivers
themselves are concerned, I must dissent from the poet, for I know no
part of the Terek worthy of comparison with the fall of the Wuokses at
Imatra, which is the very materialization of the idea of irresistible,
pitiless power.</p>
<p class="par">Although the valley is now a little wider than it was a
few miles to the south, the scenery still has the same grandeur and
sternness until we pass between the rocks that come down close to
either bank of the river, and come out into the plain in which stands
Fort Djerakhovsk, a rectangular edifice, about 120 feet long, which is
fully garrisoned. We are not quite clear of the mountains, however,
until we have passed <i>Balta</i>, and have got within five versts of
Vladikavkaz. Before us stretches a smooth, green plain as far as the
eye can reach; the contrast is most striking; it is as if we had been
suddenly transported from Switzerland to Holland.</p>

<p class="figureHead">VLADIKAVKAZ.</p>
<p class="par first">Page 66.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par"><i>Vladikavkaz</i>, 200 versts from Tiflis, lies at the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>foot of the Caucasus, at a height of 2368 feet.
The best hotel is the Pochtovaya, at the post-station; the Frantsiya is
also good. Vladikavkaz means, in Russian, &ldquo;master of the
Caucasus&rdquo; (cf. Vladivostok, Vladimir, &amp;c.&mdash;root
<i>vlad</i> is akin to German <i>walt</i>-en, Ge<i>walt</i>); the
Cherkesses (Circassians) call it Kapkai, &ldquo;gate of the
mountains.&rdquo; It has a population of over 30,000 souls, chiefly
Russians, Cherkesses, Georgians, Armenians, Persians, besides a strong
garrison. A fortress was built here in 1784, but the town never became
a trading centre of much importance until the war with Shamil; even now
one is astonished to see how little activity them is in a place through
which nearly all the overland traffic between Europe and Western Asia
passes. Several chimney stalks bear witness to the existence of
industry, but the only manufactory of any size is a spirit distillery.
The silver work of Vladikavkaz is renowned throughout the whole
Caucasus, and is much used for dagger hilts and sheaths, belts,
&amp;c.</p>
<p class="par">The city is built on the banks of the Terek, which is
here crossed by several bridges; the best quarter is on the right bank,
where there are cool, shady gardens by the waterside, and a very
respectable-looking boulevard. A few of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the streets are fairly
well paved, and there are one or two comfortable-looking houses with
pleasant grounds; but on the whole the place is not one that anybody
would care to settle down in. Were it not for the frequency with which
one sees Asiatic costumes, and hears Asiatic tongues, and the fact that
the frosty Caucasus may be seen, apparently perpendicular, rising to
its loftiest points, it would be easy to imagine oneself in some
provincial town not 100 versts from Moscow, instead of being 2000
versts from it.</p>
<p class="par">When you have lounged in the gardens, and on the
boulevard, visited the cathedral, which is still in course of
construction, the market, the military school, and the old fortress,
you have obtained all the diversion that is to be had in Vladikavkaz,
unless you are fortunate enough to find the little theatre open, and
the best thing to be done is to take the morning train to the Mineral
Waters station (186 versts in nine hours) for the town called Five
Mountains (Pyatigorsk), about twenty versts from the railway, which for
almost a hundred years has enjoyed the reputation of being the most
fashionable inland watering-place in the Russian Empire. <span class=

<h2 class="main">THE KAKHETIAN ROAD&mdash;TIFLIS TO SIGNAKH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A few days after my return from Vladikavkaz, I
made preparations for leaving Tiflis. It was near the end of June, and
the unbearable heat had driven away nearly all those who were free to
go; all the highways leading out of the city were crowded with carts
and carriages of every description, carrying household goods and
passengers. My friends had contracted with some Molokans (Russian
heretics), belonging to the colony of Azamburi, for the removal of
their furniture to Signakh; the carriers had promised to come to our
house at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, but it was nine
o&rsquo;clock before they put in an appearance, and then their carts
were half full of other people&rsquo;s goods, a direct violation of the
agreement. If any man ever needed the patience which is proverbially
ascribed to the patriarch Job, it is the man who has business dealings
with the Muscovite <i lang="ru-latn">muzhik</i>. You may assail him
with all the abuse which your knowledge <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>of his language will
permit, you may strike him, you may calmly endeavour to persuade him
with the most lucid logic&mdash;it is all to no purpose; taking off his
cap to scratch his head, he looks at you with an assumption of
childlike simplicity, and replies with a proverb more remarkable for
its laconism than for its applicability to the matter under discussion.
In this case we wrangled for a long time, and then, being unwilling to
risk a stroke of apoplexy by getting into a rage, appealed to the
majesty of the law, represented by a stalwart policeman, at whose
command the carts were emptied forthwith, the contents being deposited
on the roadside, and our effects were soon put in their place, and the
whole caravan rattled down the hillside about two hours before noon. An
hour later a four-horse carriage with springs arrived, and the four of
us, my Georgian host, a Russian lady and gentleman, and myself, set out
for Kakheti.</p>
<p class="par">After descending through the narrow streets which lie
between the Erivan square and the river, we crossed the busy bridge,
and mounted the steep bank on the other side, passing through the
liveliest part of the Persian quarter. By the time we had got clear of
the suburb called the Dogs&rsquo; Village, with its camels and
caravanserais, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>we had overtaken the waggons; exchanging friendly
salutations with our volunteer baggage-guard, we were soon rolling
along the smooth, dusty road in the direction of Orkhevi. On our right,
down by the side of the Kura, lay Naftluk, with its beautiful vineyards
and orchards, and beyond it the road to Akstafa and Erivan; on the
distant southern horizon were the blue mountains of Armenia. On our
left hand rose a range of bare-looking hills of no great height.</p>
<p class="par">The region through which the Kakhetian road passes is a
flat, waterless, almost uninhabited steppe; the winds which sometimes
sweep across it are so violent that it is the custom to seek shelter
from them by building the houses in the ground, with the roof on a
level with the road. Twenty years ago the &ldquo;Society for the
Re-establishment of Orthodox Christianity in the Caucasus&rdquo;
obtained from the late Tsar a large concession of land near Kara Yazi,
and spent 370,000 roubles on the construction of a canal for irrigation
(<span lang="ru-latn">Mariinskii Kanal</span>); the scheme was never
completely carried out, and the results obtained have not hitherto been
such as to encourage the society, although a few Nestorians, Assyrian
Christians, have been induced to settle in this unhealthy land. There
are still unmistakable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72"
name="pb72">72</a>]</span>signs of the fact that in ancient times all
this steppe was watered from the Kura by an elaborate system of
irrigation, which must have made the country very fertile; now the
whole tract is an almost unbroken wilderness, where the antelope
wanders, unharmed by any hunter.</p>
<p class="par">At <i>Orkhevi</i> there is nothing but the
station-house, and those whose only experience of posting has been
derived from the military road between Tiflis and Vladikavkaz, are
likely to be unpleasantly surprised at the primitive appearance of this
traveller&rsquo;s rest. A bare, dirty room, with two wooden benches and
a table, the walls tastefully decorated with official notices, among
which the most prominent is one in four languages warning farmers
against the phylloxera, thereon portrayed in all the various phases of
its development. Such is my remembrance of Orkhevi. The only
refreshment obtainable is a <i>samovar</i> (tea-urn) of boiling water,
from which you can make your own tea if you have the necessary
ingredients with you. A former journey along this road had already made
me familiar with all the little discomforts and privations which must
be undergone by the visitor to Kakheti, so I was not disappointed. None
of the stations are any better all the way to Signakh, and he who does
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>not bring with him his own food for the journey is
likely to have a very good appetite by the time he reaches his
destination.</p>

<p class="par">The sun had now reached the meridian, and beat down upon
us with terrible force, for our carriage was an open one; we were
half-choked with the dust, a thick white layer of which covered us from
head to foot; on either side lay bare, brown fields, baked hard as
stone, and deeply fissured; no water anywhere; the only thing which
broke the monotony of the scene was the occasional passage of a train
of <i>arbas</i>, laden with huge, bloated-looking ox-skins, full of
wine. The <i>arba</i> is the national vehicle of Georgia, and is said
to have been used as a chariot by the ancient kings; it is constructed
entirely of wood; there is not so much as a nail or pin of metal in it;
the wheels are generally made of one piece of timber, and for this
reason the <i>arba</i> is allowed to travel on the highways without
paying the tolls which are imposed on carts with tires; a pair of oxen
draw the cart, and the creaking of it may be heard afar off. Parched
with thirst, and almost stifled with dust, we were glad to reach
<i>Vaziani</i>, where we spread our cloaks under an oak-tree by the
side of a spring, and proceeded to make a good lunch, after which we
slept for a while. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the afternoon we left Vaziani, and soon passed
through the prosperous German colony of Marienfeld, with its neat,
homely cottages, shaded by fine poplar-trees. The vicinity of the river
Iora makes this a very fertile spot, cool and inviting even in the
middle of summer. A little before reaching Marienfeld we saw, on the
left, the road to Telav, and the Kakhetian hills now seem to slope down
very quickly to meet our road, but we know that we shall have to travel
many a weary verst before we reach them. In the evening, at about six
o&rsquo;clock, we arrived at Azamburi, a Russian village not far from
the station of <i>Sartachali</i>. It had been agreed that we should
spend the night here, so we alighted at the <i>postoyalii dvor</i>, or
inn.</p>
<p class="par">Azamburi is exactly like any other Russian village, a
long, dirty, double row of wretched hovels. Each farmer has his house
and buildings arranged round a square courtyard, in the midst of which
lie carts, pigs, agricultural produce, and filth of all kinds. The
inhabitants are Molokans; some account of the religious opinions of
these people will be found in Mr. D. M. Wallace&rsquo;s well-known work
on Russia; they have no priests nor sacraments, neither smoke nor
drink, do not swear, and pay great reverence to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>Bible, a
copy of which may be seen on a shelf in the living-room of every house.
They are not at all attractive, either in physiognomy or conversation;
their awful stupidity and ugliness are all the more powerfully felt
from the contrast which the native population presents to them. Their
choice of a piece of ground for colonization would be inexplicable did
we not remember their peculiar religious convictions; they have chosen
the very worst place in the whole plain; the only drinking water in the
neighbourhood is very bad, so bad that the tea made from it is almost
undrinkable, even by people accustomed to Kura water. Quite near the
village are stinking, stagnant marshes, which must make the place
terribly unhealthy.</p>
<p class="par">After dinner we went outside to smoke, for the Molokan
will not suffer the mildest cigarette in his house, and even in the
depth of winter the visitor who smokes must burn his weed in the open
air. Returning along the road for some little distance, followed by a
crowd of children, who, evidently, had never before seen a lady in
European dress, we mounted a little hill, whence we saw in the distance
our baggage-waggons slowly approaching. In re-entering the village we
overtook a farmer with an English reaping-machine; this man was less
taciturn than his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span>neighbours, and of his own accord entered
into conversation with us; he was loud in his praises of the reaper,
and said that the man who invented a certain part of it (a patent
screw, I think) ought to be &ldquo;kissed behind the ear.&rdquo; We
tried to interest him in a pet idea of our own, viz., that village
communities should buy machinery collectively, but we regret to say
that we could not make a convert of him.</p>
<p class="par">It was nine o&rsquo;clock before our young friend,
Prince Giorgi, arrived with the goods under his charge; and while we
were at supper much merriment was caused by his vain endeavours to
check himself in the use of the word <i>chort</i> (the devil!), a pet
expression of his, but strictly forbidden in the houses of all good
Molokans. The night being fine, although the air was cool, we made up
our minds to sleep outside rather than risk the onslaughts of the
Molokan fleas, and we chose for our bivouac a thrashing-floor about a
hundred yards from the house; here we lay down, wrapped in our
<i>burkas</i>, and smoked and chatted until we fell asleep. But we were
not to have a quiet night; we were roused by the attack of some
ferocious dogs; we beat them off several times, but the numbers ever
increased, until all the canine population of Azamburi was howling
round us.</p>
<p class="par">We were on foot at three o&rsquo;clock, and, waking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>up the drivers, got the horses harnessed and
started for Kakabeti. In the early morning air flitted beautiful birds
with wings as brilliant as those of butterflies, and butterflies as big
as birds. It was not so terribly hot as I had found it some weeks
before, when I passed through Kakabeti in the afternoon, but it was
still close enough to make us long for a breath of the mountain air.
This region is swampy, and the fevers make it uninhabitable.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Kakabeti</i> offers nothing of interest. The same
wearisome plain stretches all the way to <i>Kajereti</i>, near which is
the hospitable abode of one of the Andronikov family. We spent four
hours there, and did not leave the station until an hour after noon.
Passing the inviting-looking post-road to Bakurtsikhe, on our left, we
kept to the plain for a while; then rapidly rising to the village of
Nukriani, Signakh came into view at the top of the hill, and the lovely
woodlands at our feet seemed all the more beautiful on account of the
bare, monotonous character of the parched plain where we had spent the
last two days. Descending by a zigzag road, we entered the town, and,
passing along the main street, through the market-place, soon reached
the very edge of the steep, high hill which rises from the Alazana
valley. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=

<h2 class="main">SIGNAKH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Our new home turned out to be a very delightful
place,&mdash;large, lofty rooms, two balconies; at the back, vineyards
and gardens stretching far down the hillside. The view was more
beautiful than any I had ever seen or imagined. The house was built on
the edge of a deep, narrow ravine, the steep sides of which were
covered with vines and mulberry-trees all the way down to the Alazana
valley, a smooth, fertile plain thirty miles broad. On the opposite
side of the ravine, to the left, stood a very extensive fortification
with ruined towers, a stronghold of some importance during the war with
Shamil; behind this could be seen the Armenian church and the outskirts
of the town. Straight in front lay the grand Caucasian mountains,
rising like a wait from the plain, their glittering snow-clad tops
dividing the dark forests on their flanks from the deep blue of the
summer sky. In the midst of the plain flowed the silvery Alazana, in
its winding course dividing the cultivated land on this side from the
virgin forest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>beyond. Along the nearer edge lay scattered
hamlets with their neat little white churches; farther off might be
seen a wood, which we always thought of as that of the Sleeping Beauty.
From the heights of Signakh it does not look large, but it is six miles
in diameter, and the underwood is so thick that it can only be
penetrated by cutting a path with axes; it is full of all sorts of wild
beasts and dangerous reptiles. In the distance on the left may be seen
the mountains on which Telav is situated; to the extreme right a few
huts on the river bank indicate the position of the Alazana bridge, and
beyond this begins the long sandy steppe which stretches in unbroken
barrenness to the Caspian.</p>
<p class="par">Signakh is 100 versts to the eastward of Tiflis, and
stands about 1000 feet above the plain of the Alazana. The population
is over 10,000, the majority being Armenian shop-keepers, usurers,
&amp;c. The name signifies &ldquo;city of refuge,&rdquo; and the place
was founded and fortified in the last century, in order to serve as a
retreat for the country people in times of Lesghian raids. The fortress
consists of a very large piece of ground enclosed by high walls, with
towers at regular intervals, and the whole city used to be within these
walls. The post-road to Bakurtsikhe runs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>through the stronghold,
and about sunset all the wealth and beauty of Signakh may be seen
promenading on the highway, for this is &ldquo;the boulevard;&rdquo; on
Sunday afternoon wrestling goes on merrily to the sound of the pipe and
drum. At present the military importance of Signakh is almost at an
end, but if Russia should ever find herself involved in a great war we
might probably hear something of the doings of the Lesghians in that
region. The garrison is very small.</p>
<p class="par">The Club is the centre of all the social life of
Signakh, and on Saturday evenings there are informal dances, to which
the stranger looks forward as a welcome break in the monotony of
provincial life. The Gostinnitsa &ldquo;Nadezhda&rdquo; (Hope Inn),
which we nicknamed &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Grand H&ocirc;tel de
Kakh&eacute;tie</span>,&rdquo; is dirty and uninviting to a degree
which Europeans could hardly imagine possible; but it is the best
hostelry in the town. The Court-house is just opposite the inn, and I
remember spending a very interesting evening there on one occasion,
watching the trial of Georgians, Tatars, Armenians, by a Russian
justice of the peace in a gorgeous uniform. The cases were settled with
a rapidity to which the High Court of Chancery is a stranger.</p>

<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=

<p class="par">Altogether, Signakh is a dirty but highly picturesque
little town; its streets are narrow, crooked, and ill-paved, the shops,
as is usual in the East, are small, open rooms, in which saddlers,
tailors, and smiths may be seen plying their respective trades; all
round about the town are beautiful hills covered with oak, walnut, and
other tall forest-trees. The only other place it reminded me of was
Amalfi, and even in this case the resemblance was but slight.</p>
<p class="par">On one of the neighbouring hills, at Bodb&eacute;, is
the Monastery of St. Nina. This venerable relic stands in one of the
finest pieces of scenery in all Kakheti, and is surrounded by a thick
forest, which has from the earliest times been protected from
destruction by a popular tradition, declaring that he who breaks off a
branch therein will die within the same year. The monastery was
originally built by King Mirian immediately after the death of the
apostle of Georgia, and her tomb may still be seen in the present
church, which, according to an inscription on one of the walls, was
restored by a certain King Giorgi, after the country had been laid
waste by Tamerlan. In the sacristy are many old manuscripts, amongst
which there are doubtless some of great historical interest, but, as
far as I know, they have not yet been catalogued. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>On the
occasion of my visit to Bodb&eacute; I passed a wine-shop, where three
or four Georgians were making merry; they pressed me to stay and drink
with them, but, offering them my thanks, I begged to be excused on the
ground of want of time. On my return they came out, hat in hand, to the
middle of the road, and presented me with a goblet, which I could not
refuse to drain without giving serious displeasure to my kind
entertainers. This little incident is a very good illustration of the
Georgian character: when the Georgian is merry, everybody else must
share his jollity or he is unhappy. I have seen a squire quite
unnecessarily leave a scene of revelry for a minute or two in order to
heap up food in his horse&rsquo;s manger, so that the faithful beast
might share in the universal joy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83"

<h2 class="main">A TRIP ACROSS THE ALAZANA.</h2>
<h2 class="main">BAKURTSIKHE&mdash;KARTUBAN&mdash;LAGODEKH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By daily excursions among the sloping vine-clad
hills I soon made myself familiar with Kakheti, the garden of Georgia;
at Kodalo I had shared the munificent hospitality of the Andronikovs,
at Bakurtsikhe that of the Vachnadzes; but I had never been in the wild
country beyond the Alazana, and it was with pleasure that I accepted
the invitation of the Princes Vachnadze to accompany them on their
yearly visit to their estates at Kartuban, on the River Kabalo, at the
foot of the mountains on the other side of the plain.</p>
<p class="par">Accordingly, on a certain bright summer morning our
cavalcade might have been seen winding down the steep main street of
Signakh. The first halting-place was to be Bakurtsikhe, seventeen
versts from Signakh, where we had been invited to meet a large company
of Kakhetian squires and ladies at dinner. Our path, for some miles
after leaving the town, lay in the dry bed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>of a
torrent. The remembrance of the wild, beautiful scenery of that narrow
gorge still fills me with delightful emotions. It was the scene of so
many pleasant rides&mdash;in the fierce heat of the noonday sun, in the
cool of evening, after midnight on stormy nights, when we had returned
homewards drenched with rain, our path illumined only by dazzling
flashes of lightning. As we picked our way among the stones we met many
a courteous gentleman, most of them clad in the same Circassian garb as
ourselves, but not a few, especially the older men, in the true
national garb&mdash;a short tunic, with long flaps of cloth hanging
from the shoulders; a dress said to resemble the ancient Polish
costume. Each raised his tall <i>papakh</i> of Astrakhan fur, and, with
graceful bow, saluted us, after the manner of the country, with the
word <i>Gamardjw&eacute;ba</i>, which is, being interpreted, &ldquo;I
wish thee the victory,&rdquo; to which we answered
<i>Gaguimardjos</i>&mdash;&ldquo;May God grant thee the victory.&rdquo;
These salutations are as eloquent as a dozen volumes of history. I
never heard them without thinking of the sad but glorious past of the
Georgian kingdom, nobly holding its own, unaided, and witnessing for
Christ and His Cross against all the hosts of Islam, performing
prodigies of valour that would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"

or Rome. God grant thee the victory, brave Georgia!</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Emerging from the glen, we joined the post road at
Anaga, and our impatient horses set off at a gallop. On we sped through
the well-kept vineyards of a Russian capitalist, Count Sheremetiev, who
threatens to ruin all the poor squires of the district by selling his
wines under cost price. At a little village, about half-way between
Signakh and Bakurtsikhe, two of us had far outstripped the rest, and
were racing neck to neck when my companion&rsquo;s horse cast a shoe;
so leaving him at a roadside smithy, I went on alone. The fierce summer
sun stood high in the blue arch of heaven; on my left were vine-clad
crags; to the right, beyond the river, rose the white peaks of the
mountain wall between me and Europe. But I thought not of Europe. I
forgot kindred, country, humanity&mdash;everything. My horse and I were
one, and we were merged in that great, living ocean of life&mdash;our
mother earth. My pulse beat in harmony with the heart of Nature
herself, keeping time with the rippling rills, the whisper of the
wandering airs to the leaves of the trembling trees. I had entered a
blissful Nirvana, in which all consciousness of self was swallowed up
in the world&rsquo;s soul. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I had ridden half a mile beyond the point whence I
should have ascended by a bridle-path to our host&rsquo;s house, before
the cool shade of a cliff aroused me from my state of forgetfulness. It
was on the summit of this cliff that my friends had recently met their
tenants to discuss some little differences that had arisen between
them. Honest folk do not like law-courts&mdash;especially Russian
law-courts&mdash;so the good Kakhetians decided to settle their dispute
in the old-fashioned, orthodox manner. A couple of horses were killed,
and a good many men on either side were pretty severely hacked and
bruised; but the landlords came off victorious. They, nevertheless,
agreed to grant certain concessions to the farmers, so all left the
field of battle delighted with one another. It is only just to say that
this case was an exceptional one. The relations between the gentry and
peasantry are excellent; they are on terms of such affectionate
familiarity that the latter always address their prince by his pet
name.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after noon we were all enjoying the hospitality of
our friend. When I say hospitality, I am not using the word in its
conventional sense; a Georgian displays towards his guest such courtesy
and kindness as are unknown among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87"
href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>European peoples. Other friends
soon arrived, and at three o&rsquo;clock, the usual dinner-hour, a
score of us sat down to dine in a shady arbour on the hillside. The
dishes were purely Oriental; rich <i lang="ka-latn">pilavi</i> (rice
cooked with fruits, pistachio nuts, &amp;c.), <i lang=
"ka-latn">shishlik</i> (a choice cut of mutton roasted on a silver
skewer over a yard long, on which it is served up), and many another
delicacy, the thought of which makes my mouth water even now. The wine
deserves special mention. Kakheti has one of the finest soils in the
world for grape-growing, and any kind of wine, including fine
champagne, can be produced there. Unfortunately, the people in general
have not yet become acquainted with the methods by which wine has to be
&ldquo;manipulated&rdquo; in order to make it at once agreeable to a
European palate. Some of the best brands are not, however, open to this
objection, and are largely sold in Petersburg and Moscow, but they are
not so well known as they deserve to be. Merchants discourage the
introduction of new wines, as our Australian and South African
fellow-subjects know to their cost; but the day will undoubtedly come
when Caucasian vintages will be known and appreciated.</p>
<p class="par">The drinking habits of the Georgians are interesting. A
toastmaster (<i lang="ka-latn">tolumbash</i>) is always <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>chosen,
and it is his duty to propose the health of each guest in turn. To
those who do not drain their glasses before the time for the next toast
has arrived, the <i lang="ka-latn">tolumbash</i> cries <i lang=
"ka-latn">Alaverdi!</i> to which the laggard replies, <i lang=
"ka-latn">Yakhsheol</i>, and immediately finishes the draught, in order
to escape the penalty of swallowing a large hornful of liquor at a
breath. These words are of Tatar origin, and commemorate a brave Tatar
named Alaverdi, who fell in a battle between the Georgians and
Persians. The glasses contain a quarter of a pint, and the stranger who
sits down with a score of friends is somewhat apprehensive as to the
condition in which he will leave the table. Luckily, the wine is
nothing but pure grape-juice, and a person with a tolerably strong head
can dispose of two or three quarts of it without feeling much the
worse. Each toast is accompanied by the singing of a grand old song
called <i lang="ka-latn">Mraval djamier ghmerthma inebos</i> (May God
grant thee many years), to which the person thus honoured must sing the
reply, <i lang="ka-latn">Madlobeli vart</i> (I thank you). I have
transcribed the song in the Appendix. The ladies drink water scarcely
coloured with wine.</p>
<p class="par">Our dinner lasted more than two hours, and concluded
with some miscellaneous toasts, among <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>which those of England
and her Queen were received with the greatest enthusiasm. Then, after
tea, the guests amused themselves with music and dancing, and nightfall
found us all, young and old, chasing one another about on the hillside
in the games of cat-and-mouse and blindman&rsquo;s buff. It was past
midnight before we retired to rest; some of us lay on the low,
carpet-covered <i lang="ka-latn">takhti</i>, or divans, which in
Georgia replace beds, while those who preferred it slept out on the
green, wrapped up in their cloaks.</p>
<p class="par">It had been arranged that we should start for the
Alazana on the following morning at four o&rsquo;clock, in order to
escape the terrible midday heat of the low-lying plains by the
river-side; but when we rose we found that a couple of the horses had
disappeared, and this delayed us for two or three hours. At length we
started, and, waving farewells to all our good friends at Bakurtsikhe,
we proceeded down the long slope to the plain. There were six of us,
besides a servant, and we were armed to the teeth, after the manner of
the country, with daggers, pistols, swords, and rifles&mdash;not an
unnecessary precaution, for we saw ploughmen with a double-barrelled
gun slung over the shoulder, and sword and dagger at the girdle, while
a man stood at the end <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90"
name="pb90">90</a>]</span>of the furrow ready to give the alarm. These
fertile lands are only half tilled. The wild Lesghian marauders come
down upon the farms, and steal all that can be carried away, and in the
event of a war they would simply burn up the whole country to the very
gates of Tiflis.</p>
<p class="par">It was a weary journey down to the river-bank, and we
did not reach the ferry until noon. The ferryman lives in a hut a good
way from the river, and it was only after firing half a dozen shots in
the air that we succeeded in attracting his attention. That half-hour
of waiting among the reeds, with the sun right overhead, was the
warmest half-hour I ever spent. At length the ferry-boat, a long
tree-trunk with the inside burnt out of it, came across the stream, and
we took our saddles and bridles and laid them in it. The horses had, of
course, to swim, and it was a long and difficult task to get them all
over. The current is very strong, and it was a subject for
congratulation that none of them were carried away by it. Excepting at
the ferry, the banks are so steep that it is impossible to land. When
all had safely reached the other side we lay down under the shade of
the trees, and lunched off cucumbers and coarse bread, washed down by
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>white Kakhetian wine, of which we carried a full
sheepskin.</p>
<p class="par">The hottest part of our day&rsquo;s work was over;
instead of burnt, shadowless plains we should now have the sunless
forest to ride through until we reached our halting-place for the
night. But we well knew that we should not be in clover for the rest of
the day, for we had often been told that this wood was infested by a
horse-fly of a very malignant character, and as we rode along the
northward path we had an opportunity of making the acquaintance of the
insect in question. Within a mile of the bank we were surrounded by
swarms of them, and the horses, becoming more and more restless, at
last went perfectly mad with pain, while the blood dripped plentifully
from their flanks. To think of holding them in by bit and bridle was
out of the question, the only thing to be done was to let them gallop
ahead and to keep a sharp look-out for the many boughs that overhung
the scarcely perceptible track. Although Georgia is not in the tropics,
this was a truly tropical forest with all its luxuriant and beautiful
vegetation; walnut and other fancy woods abound, but they are allowed
to fall and rot unutilized; the undergrowth on either hand is so thick
as to be impenetrable; on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href=
"#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>all sides are masses of strange,
bright flowers, making the air heavy with perfume, and birds of
dazzling plumage sit chattering on every tree.</p>
<p class="par">About an hour before sunset we reached the river Kabalo,
a swift, shallow mountain stream, which we forded, and then rode up a
fine glade to the encampment of my friends&rsquo; Tatar herdsmen. About
a score of families live there all the summer in large tents, which are
not altogether devoid of comfort; in the interior may be seen carpeted
divans, gold and silver ornaments are not uncommon, and the copper
household utensils are thoroughly artistic in shape and beautifully
engraved. We dismounted at the chief man&rsquo;s tent, and, lying down
on the greensward, waited impatiently for dinner. The fare was abundant
and good, as was to be expected in a country so rich in game and fish,
and we slaked our thirst with cool <i>kumiss</i> (fermented
mare&rsquo;s milk). The Tatars are fine, bold-looking fellows; there is
in their faces a look of wild freedom that is extremely attractive to
one who has spent the most of his life in cities. I believe that if I
had stayed a week or two in that camp on the Kabalo, I should have been
content to renounce civilized life altogether. A very houri, a gazelle
of the wilderness, a sixteen-year old maiden in red tunic <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>and wide
trousers, with long dark hair in countless tiny braids and pretty
little white bare feet and ankles, cast timid glances in our direction,
and lovely, languorous eyes said as plainly as possible, &ldquo;Fly to
the desert! fly with me&rdquo; ... and many other things which the
curious reader may find recorded in the works of the late Mr. Thos.
Moore.</p>
<p class="par">At nightfall we rode away, accompanied by a few Tatars,
to visit the large herds of horses and cattle which feed near here, and
then proceeded to the little cluster of cottages where the Georgian
farm-labourers live, about a couple of miles higher up the river. We
were received by the steward, a Greek from Cilicia, and after chatting
merrily over our tea for a few hours, we spread our <i>burkas</i> on
the ground and slept as well as the clouds of fierce mosquitoes would
allow us to do, under the starlit sky, lulled by the music of the
stream.</p>
<p class="par">About an hour before dawn the cold aroused us all, and
after a bath in the icy waters of the Kabalo, and a hasty breakfast, we
visited the farm-buildings. Tobacco is the chief commodity produced,
but its cultivation is at present rather unprofitable; I saw three
hundred bales of the finest leaves of last year&rsquo;s growth lying in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>store unsold; it is quite equal to Turkish, and
can be bought at a ridiculously low price, but it is not yet known in
Europe, even in Russia &ldquo;Batumskii tabak&rdquo; has only recently
been introduced, although it is far superior to that which is grown on
the Don. Georgian landowners cannot afford to push the sale of their
wares in Europe, but I am sure that if English firms would send out
buyers they would not regret it, unless they dealt with the wily
Armenian middle-man instead of the Georgian producer. The fear of the
Lesghian robber-bands prevents any great outlay of capital in the
development of such a district, and, indeed, nobody in Georgia has much
capital to spare, so the greater part of the estate I am speaking of,
hundreds of square miles in extent, is a pathless forest.</p>
<p class="par">By eight o&rsquo;clock we were in the saddle. The path
rises through thick woodlands to the summit of a hill crossed by a
narrow, rocky pass which has an unpleasant reputation as being the
haunt of brigands; only a few weeks before, a party of travellers had
been attacked there, two of their number were wounded, and they were
all relieved of their purses, jewellery, and arms. We were within half
a mile of the top when we perceived a Lesghian prowling about a little
in advance of us. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95"
name="pb95">95</a>]</span>We halted, unslung our fire-arms and loaded,
then extending for attack, as far as the nature of of the country would
allow, we went forward at a quick walking pace. We soon caught sight of
three more Lesghians, but this was evidently the whole force, for they
contented themselves with looking at us from a distance, and seeing
that the odds were in our favour, they galloped away into the depths of
the forest, and left us to pursue our journey unmolested.</p>
<p class="par">Climbing to the summit of the hill, we enjoyed a
splendid view of the Alazana valley from the opposite side to that
whence we had been accustomed to see it; behind us rose the white peaks
of the Caucasus, looking very near in the clear morning air. A little
way off the blue smoke rising from among the trees showed us where our
friends, the highwaymen, were cooking their breakfast. To the eastward,
almost at the foot of the hill, lay the Russian military colony of
Mikhailovka, to which we descended.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Mikhailovka</i> is fairly prosperous compared with
other Russian colonies in Transcaucasia, but to a European it does not
seem an Arcadia; it is one wide, straggling street of poor,
dirty-looking farmhouses. The colonists have to struggle with fever and
ague, not to speak of Lesghians, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>altogether do not seem to
enjoy their life very much. Mikhailovka is the point at which the
military road from Signakh turns to the eastward, and about five miles
farther on arrives at Lagodekh, the staff head-quarters of an army
corps, into which we rode about an hour before noon.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lagodekh</i> is a place of some size, with wide,
clean streets and large grassy squares, planted with fine trees, the
houses are neat and comfortable-looking. Swift mountain streams run
through it and supply delicious water. The public buildings comprise
barracks, hospital, stores, a fine church of red sandstone, a modest
club-house, bazar, &amp;c. We made our way to the quarters of an
officer of the 39th, whose hospitality we enjoyed until evening. In
spite of the terrible heat, our host showed us everything worth seeing.
The park is the great attraction, it is beautifully kept, and contains
a fine long avenue of tall poplars; in the middle of it is a pavilion
with the garrison ball-room, and near the entrance may be seen a small
cemetery where there is a real, old-fashioned ghost, which, under the
semblance of a white lady carrying a cross, affrights the local Tommy
Atkins every year in the month of June. I commend this sprite to the
attention of the Psychical Research <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97"
href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>Society, and I am quite willing
to proceed to Lagodekh and spend a month there in investigating the
matter&mdash;at the Society&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p class="par">The troops suffer a good deal in the summer months, and
there are many casualties from apoplexy, dysentery, and other
complaints.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the afternoon we sat down to dinner, and did
full justice to the fare. My neighbour on the right was the brother of
a charming lady whom I had met in Tiflis, and it so happened that he
had that very day received from her a letter in which I was spoken of,
for Englishmen are rare birds in these lands. This gentleman had
wandering proclivities almost as strong as my own, and he informed me
that he thought of travelling overland by Merv to India, &ldquo;where
the English pay private soldiers as much as the Russians pay a
captain.&rdquo; After dinner we all slept for an hour, and then, the
heat having slightly diminished, we started for Mikhailovka. A bear
hunt was to take place on the following day, and we were urgently
pressed to stay and take part in it, but we had to be back in Signakh
within the next twenty-four hours, and were therefore obliged to deny
ourselves this pleasure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Before we were clear of Lagodekh somebody had the
unfortunate idea of starting a wild gallop, but the spot was badly
chosen, for a sudden turn in the road brought us to a river with a
wide, stony bed. The leading horse threw his rider into the very middle
of the stream, I was deposited on a heap of big stones on the other
side; all the rest, warned by our mishap, escaped. It took over an hour
to catch the runaway horses, and when we reached Mikhailovka I felt as
if I had passed through a thrashing-mill, every bone was aching. Our
camping-ground was under a large oak-tree, behind a peasant&rsquo;s
house, and we lay there on the ground, a prey to the mosquitoes, until
early morning.</p>
<p class="par">At half-past four we were in the saddle, and after a
stirrup-cup of Russian vodka, galloped down the smooth, well-kept
military road towards the Alazana, occasionally glancing back at the
beautiful hill country behind us. I felt all my many bruises with
double force after the night&rsquo;s rest, and it was as much as I
could do to keep my seat, not to speak of emulating the exploits of my
companions, who were amusing themselves with shots at the hares and
feathered game with which the country abounds. At length, at about
eight o&rsquo;clock, we reached the <i>Chiauri Bridge</i>, a
shaky-looking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>wooden structure. There is a wretched little
wine-shop, where we dismounted for breakfast. A fine fish of fifteen
pounds&rsquo; weight, with some of the coarse, indiarubber-like bread
of the country, formed the solid part of the meal; I need not say what
the liquid part of it was; we emptied our sheepskin and then fell back
on mine host&rsquo;s supplies. The river, in summer at least, is
sluggish and dirty, and has an evil smell of decaying vegetable matter,
very suggestive of malarial fever; if our acquaintance with the Alazana
had been confined to this portion of it, we should have been at a loss
to understand the high praise which has been bestowed on it by all the
sweet singers of Rustaveli&rsquo;s land.</p>
<p class="par">We spent a couple of hours in rest and refreshment, and
then started for home across the broad plain yellow with ripe grain.
Noon saw us begin the toilsome ascent of the hills of Signakh, and an
hour later we were lying on our balcony dreamily smoking cigarettes of
Kartuban tobacco, while we mentally retraced every step of our
delightful journey among the fair scenes which now lay spread at our
feet. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=

<h2 class="main">SIGNAKH TO TELAV, AND THENCE TO TIFLIS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">My stay in Kakheti was so pleasant that I found it
very hard to leave. My good friends there insisted that I should marry
a Georgian lady and settle down as a country squire, to grow wine and
drink it among them for the remainder of my natural life; when I
finally decided upon the day for my departure they pressed me to stay,
at least, until the vintage-time, but I still had much ground to go
over, and I had made up my mind to return to England before winter set
in.</p>
<p class="par">One morning in July I said good-bye to Signakh, and set
out in a post-cart for Telav. As far as Bakurtsikhe the road was quite
familiar to me; it had never seemed so beautiful as it did when I said
farewell to it. Then came Kalaki, which like Bakurtsikhe, is full of
members of the Vachnadze family, and Gurdjani, one of the villages
belonging to the Andronikovs. The Andronikovs are descended from a
Byzantine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>prince who fled to Georgia during the reign of
Queen Tamara; they have always been distinguished for bravery and
munificence, the two virtues which are most appreciated in this
country; in the present century they have produced a general worthy to
rank with any who have ever served the Tsars. I may say, in passing,
that it is astonishing to find what a large percentage of the great
military leaders in the Russian army have been and are of Georgian
birth. Another curious circumstance is that some of the best families
in Georgia are of foreign origin; the Bagrats, the royal family, were
once Hebrews, and claim to be descended from David, the son of Jesse;
the Orbelianis, the second family in the kingdom, came from China; the
Andronikovs, as we have just remarked, were originally Greeks.</p>
<p class="par">Near Gurdjani is <i>Akhtala</i>, a muddy hollow in which
are slime baths, resorted to by persons suffering from rheumatism,
scrofula, and many other diseases; the baths are simply round holes
full of mud, in the middle of which an evil-smelling gas slowly bubbles
up; the largest bath of all is reserved for cattle. I need hardly say
that all the bathing goes on <i>al fresco</i>, for nobody has thought
of building a hydropathic establishment <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>in this remote corner
of the Caucasus. Akhtala has, of course, its legend. It is said that a
farmer was once working in his vineyard on the Feast of the
Transfiguration, when a passer-by asked him why he was not at church on
so holy a day. The scoffer replied that he had seen enough of
transfigurations, he and his wife had been transfigured into old
people, and their children into men and women; the wayfarer, who was
none other than our Lord, said, &ldquo;Well, you shall see yet another
transfiguration,&rdquo; whereupon the ground opened, and belched forth
a liquid mass, which swallowed up the vineyard, with the sinner and all
his household.</p>
<p class="par">The road continues to run parallel to the Alazana, and
the next station is <i>Mukuzani</i>, seventeen versts from Bakurtsikhe,
near which is the flourishing town of Velistsikhe. All this region is a
fertile, well-cultivated plain, and there are many villages renowned
for their wines; the peasants of the Telav district are much wealthier
than those near Signakh. <i>Akuri</i>, fourteen versts from Mukuzani,
is the last station. The city of Telav is now visible on the top of a
hill straight in front, and it has a very picturesque appearance.</p>
<p class="par">About half a dozen miles beyond Akuri, in a beautiful
valley, is <i>Tsinondal</i>, formerly the home <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>of
Prince David Chavchavadze, but now the property of Alexander
Alexandrovich, Autocrat of all the Russias, for whom a vast palace was
being built at the time of my visit. The Tsar would be far safer here
than at Gachina, for there are no anarchists among the Georgians, and I
cannot account for the rumour that it was proposed to exile a large
number of the young nobles, in order to assure the monarch&rsquo;s
safety during his sojourn in the Caucasus.</p>
<p class="par">Tsinondal is famous as the scene of one of the most
dramatic incidents of the war with Shamil, viz., the capture of
Princesses Chavchavadze and Orbeliani in July, 1854. On account of
rumours of Lesghian raids the Chavchavadze family had not left Tiflis
for their estates until the month of July. They arrived safely at
Tsinondal, and were soon joined by Nina Chavchavadze&rsquo;s sister,
Princess Varvara Orbeliani, whose husband had just been killed while
fighting against the Turks. They were but newly settled in their summer
quarters, when Prince Chavchavadze received orders to go and take the
command of a fortress some distance from home. Before leaving, he
reassured his family by telling them that reinforcements were about to
be sent to Telav, and that the Alazana was so high that the enemy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>could not cross it. In a few days the prince
wrote to his wife to say that he was besieged by a force of five or six
thousand Lesghians, but had no fear of the place being taken; if he
thought it advisable for his family to leave Tsinondal, he would let
them know.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile the Lesghians were nearer than was imagined,
and the flames from burning villages in the neighbourhood soon warned
the family that no time was to be lost. First of all the peasants came
and begged the princess to fly to the woods with them; then the gentry
of the district offered their aid for the same purpose, but these
offers were declined; her husband had told her to stay there, and there
she would stay. At length, the advance of the enemy had proceeded so
far in the direction of Tsinondal, that the princess consented to have
all her plate and jewels packed up one night, ready for flight on the
morrow; but it was too late. Soon after dawn the Lesghians were in the
gardens of the castle. The family doctor and a handful of servants
gallantly held the gate for a few minutes, but they were soon shot
down, and the place was in the hands of the wild men of the
mountains.</p>
<p class="par">The women and children sought refuge in a garret, whence
they heard the smashing of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=
"#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>mirrors, pianos, and other
furniture. A few Lesghians soon discovered the hiding-place of the
terrified family, and each seized a woman or child as his share of the
booty. As they bore away their prisoners the staircase broke under
their weight, and all fell in a confused heap on the lower floor. Then
there was a murderous fight for the possession of the ladies; their
garments were torn to shreds, and some of them were wounded. The
conquerors picked up the senseless victims from a heap of dead
Lesghians, and forced them to mount on horseback behind them.</p>
<p class="par">The passage of the Alazana was accomplished with great
danger, and when they reached the other side the half-naked ladies were
wet, chilled, and miserable. Strange to tell, Princess Baratov, a
beautiful girl of eighteen, had not lost any article of dress, and was
as richly attired as if she had been on her way to a ball. But poor
Mdme. Dran&ccedil;ay, the French governess, had nothing left but a
chemise and a corset. A handful of Georgians attempted a rescue; the
Lesghians mistook them for the skirmishers in advance of an army, and
fled. Princess Nina Chavchavadze had an infant in her arms, and after
riding for some distance she was so wearied that the baby fell and was
trampled under the horses&rsquo; feet. She would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>have
leaped after it, but her captor held her fast, and another man coolly
cut the child&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p class="par">Finding the number of prisoners too large, the Lesghians
killed sixty of them on the road. All the villages on the way were
burned, and their inhabitants butchered. Then they mounted through a
thick forest and up among the mountains to Pokhalski, where Shamil was
staying with an army of ten thousand men. There they were joined by a
new prisoner, Niko Chavchavadze, who, with thirty Georgians, had held a
castle for three days against five hundred Lesghians, and only
surrendered when he had not a cartridge left. Shamil ordered the
princess to write to Tiflis saying that all the prisoners would be
handed over to Russia in exchange for his son, Djemal Eddin, and a fair
ransom. In the meantime the ladies had to make themselves veils of
muslin, and they lived in the harem of Shamil. They were, however,
treated honourably, and they always had the highest respect for the
great warrior and prophet.</p>
<p class="par">Eight months elapsed before the negotiations were
concluded, and on the 10th of March, 1855, the exchange took place at
Kasafiurte. Djemal Eddin, Shamil&rsquo;s son, had since his early youth
been held as a hostage at Petersburg. He was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>most
amiable man; had become perfectly Russian in his way of life, and spoke
Russian, French, and German fluently; he was colonel of a regiment, and
aide-de-camp to the Tsar. It was with deep regret that he left
civilization to return to the wild life of his native mountains, and in
1858 he died of a broken heart.</p>
<p class="par">Mounting the sloping Tsivi hills, the road enters
<i>Telav</i> by the Boulevard, at one end of which is the inn; but on
my applying for lodgings I was told that the house was under repair,
and travellers could not be entertained. I was recommended to go to
&ldquo;The Club.&rdquo; At the Club the room offered me was so dirty
and cheerless that I decided to make the post-house my headquarters. It
was only one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and I determined to have
an early dinner. In a town like Telav, thought I, it will be possible
to get something to eat. I first addressed myself to the postmaster,
who replied that boiling-water was the only refreshment he could offer
me, but held out the hope that I might get dinner in the town. I
wandered up and down the streets for an hour, hungry, thirsty, and hot,
and then found a dirty eating-house where I refreshed myself with
vodka, eggs, wine, and bread. It took three quarters of an hour to boil
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>the eggs! I leave the reader to imagine whether
my first impressions of Telav were favourable or not. I returned to the
station and slept.</p>
<p class="par">It was beginning to get cooler before I went to examine
the objects of interest in the town. Telav, the capital of the ancient
kingdom of Kakheti, lies in a very strong position on two hills, about
1400 feet above the Alazana. It was founded by King Grigal I., first
king of Kakheti, destroyed by the Persians under Shah Abbas in the
sixteenth century, and rebuilt by Irakli II. The present population is
about eight or nine thousand. In going from the post-house to the
centre of the town I passed through a gateway in the old wall, which
used to surround the whole city, and is of great antiquity. On the left
is the palace of Irakli II., now used as a grammar-school for young
gentlewomen, and in it may be seen the room where the old hero died, on
January 11th, 1798. There are a couple of interesting old churches,
containing curious pictures and ornaments of a certain artistic value.
The main street is well paved, and has a long arcade under which are
the chief shops. Telav is much more cheerful than Signakh, although the
population is smaller, and there are comparatively few Armenians. From
a low bridge across the dry <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>bed of a torrent, one gets a
splendid view over the Alazana to the Caucasian range and the country
of the Tushes.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

<p class="figureHead">THE CITY WALL, TELAV.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">When I had seen all the sights of Telav, I felt bored to
death, and was just preparing to leave the Boulevard for a walk in the
country, when a handsome boy of fourteen, in a cadet&rsquo;s uniform,
ran up and welcomed me effusively. It was young Prince M&mdash;&mdash;,
whom I had met in Tiflis. He was soon followed by his father, a retired
colonel, who has done good service for the great white Tsar, and has
been wounded more than once. Although I had only seen him once or twice
before, he reproached me for not coming to take up my quarters at his
house, and repeatedly urged me to stay a few days with him. But I had
made up my mind to leave for Tiflis early on the following morning. We
took a walk in the park called Nadikari, given to the town by the
Vakhvakhovs, and enjoyed enchanting views of the Alazana dale and the
mountains. Returning to my friend&rsquo;s house, we supped, and sat
over our wine until past midnight. When I left for the post-house the
grey-headed warrior and his pretty son embraced me and wished me every
good thing. They insisted upon sending with me a servant who carried
wine and bread for my journey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At four o&rsquo;clock on the following morning I left my
wooden couch, and seated myself in the stage-coach for Tiflis. I only
had two companions, an Armenian trader of the most objectionable
description, and a Georgian schoolmaster on his way to Odessa for a
holiday. The latter was a very jolly fellow, and intelligent withal. He
was an ardent champion of the doctrines of the First Revolution, and of
the modern principle of nationality. He soon entered into conversation
with me. My unmistakably foreign accent immediately roused his
curiosity, and when I told him that I was English he steadfastly
refused to believe me, asserting that I was a Mingrelian. The road
passes through a few villages, and then, as it mounts by the side of
the river, the houses become scarcer. On the right are many square
holes in the face of a steep cliff; they are said, like those between
Tiflis and Mtzkhet, to have been used as places of refuge in time of
war, and they are approached from a monastery on the top of the hill.
On the left is the monastery of the Mother of God, a favourite resort
of the people of Telav. The track then runs along the bottom of the
valley, on the right bank of the river Turdo, amid rich woodland
scenery.</p>
<p class="par">It takes a long time to mount to the summit of
<i>Gambori</i>. This winding road had only recently <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>been
opened to traffic, and there is no posting yet. The best means of
conveyance is the daily coach, and it is a slow and uncomfortable
vehicle. I had been advised to make a good meal at Gambori station,
and, as the coach waits there for half an hour, I entered the
<i>dukhan</i>, or wine-shop, with this object in view. Alas! nothing
was to be had but vodka, tobacco, and matches! Beyond Gambori the
scenery becomes quite English-looking for a time. There is abundance of
game of all kinds, and I saw two fine deer run across the road behind
us. Climbing to a grassy knoll, bare of trees, we arrived at length at
the Pass of Gambori, deservedly called Cold Mountain (6044 feet above
sea level, and thirty-four versts from Telav), and, leaving Kakheti
behind us, descended into the valley of the Iora and the province of
Kartli. Passing the ruined castle of Verena, built in the fifth century
by King Gurgaslan, we enjoy an ever-changing view of indescribable
loveliness all the way to Lager.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lager</i>, as the name indicates, is a military post,
and is of some importance on account of its position, about half-way
between Tiflis and Telav; it is the summer quarters of a brigade. The
garrison was not at that time very large, but there was some talk of
increasing it; indeed, we met a couple of hundred men and half a dozen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>guns only a few versts beyond the village. The
heat was terrible, and we could not help pitying the poor soldiers, who
were cursing and sweating as they toiled up the mountain side. The
radical schoolmaster began to descant on the advantages of universal
disarmament, but he was interrupted by a good little peasant woman from
the Russian colony at Lager, who replied that it was certainly very
hard, but &ldquo;if we had not a large army the English would come and
make slaves of us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The next station was <i>Udjarma</i>, a fortress of great
importance from the third century to the fifteenth, but now an
uninteresting place, chiefly remarkable for the fact that the village
graveyard is on the top of a very steep, isolated hill. From this point
the road becomes dull; it crosses a bare, windy plain, and is as
wearisome as the Signakh road, which it meets near Vaziani. The white
church of St. David&rsquo;s was soon seen glittering in the sun; then
Orkhevi was passed, and not long after sunset we entered Tiflis, hot,
dusty, tired, and hungry, after our journey of 70 versts. I spent two
days in Tiflis, where the heat had by that time become stifling; then I
regretfully doffed my Circassian garb, and again submitted to the
bondage of the stiff linen collar. On the afternoon of the third day I
was in Baku. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=

<h2 class="main">THE HISTORY OF GEORGIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Georgian history may be said to begin with
<i>Pharnavaz</i>, the first king of the country, who reigned in the
third century <span class="sc">B.C.</span> It is to him that the
invention of the ordinary civil alphabet is commonly attributed. From
this remote date down to the present time we have an almost unbroken
narrative, the trustworthiness of which is proved by its agreement with
the annals of other lands. Those who are specially interested in the
early history will find in the sequel such bibliographical references
as will enable them to satisfy their curiosity; but the present sketch
will be confined to the more modern period, beginning in the eleventh
century <span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1089 <i>David II.</i>, of the Bagratid line,
descended, if we are to believe tradition, from David the Psalmist
(note the harp and the sling in the royal arms of Georgia), as well as
from Pharnavaz, came to the throne. During the reigns of his immediate
predecessors the land had been mercilessly laid waste by the Seldjukid
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>Turks; but the successes of the Crusaders, and
the temporary decline of the Mahometan power in the East, enabled him
to raise his country to a very high position. Having boldly attacked
the Turks, and driven them out of every part of his dominions, he set
himself to rebuild cities, fortresses, and churches, purged the state
and the church of many abuses, and liberally encouraged education.
These deeds have won for him the name of <i>David the Renewer</i>.
Georgia enjoyed prosperity for the next hundred years, and then came
the zenith of the national glory.</p>
<p class="par">In 1184 <i>Queen Tamara</i> succeeded her father, and
reigned twenty-eight years, the happiest and most glorious period in
the history of the country. The queen had the good fortune to be
surrounded by wise counsellors and brave generals, but it is chiefly to
her own virtues that her success is to be ascribed. The military
exploits in which she was engaged spread her fame throughout the whole
of Asia. Erzerum, Dovin, Trebizond, Sinope, Samsun, Kars, and Ani saw
the triumph of the Georgian arms, the renowned Rokn Eddin was signally
defeated, and the Persians were terror-stricken by her expedition to
Khorassan.</p>
<p class="par">Yet she did not neglect home affairs; she was the
orphan&rsquo;s mother, the widow&rsquo;s judge. Religion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>was
the moving force in everything that she did; when a large booty was
captured, a portion of it was always set aside for the Blessed Virgin,
and churches soon sprang up in every village. She daily spent much time
in prayer, and made garments for the poor with her own fair, queenly
hands. There is a tradition to the effect that she every day did as
much work as would pay for her food, and although this is probably an
exaggeration, it serves to show what the character of the queen
was.</p>
<p class="par">Her literary talents were of no mean order; when she had
won a battle, she could, like Deborah, tell forth her triumph in a
sweet, glad song to the Lord of Hosts, and one, at least, of these
psalms is still preserved; but it is chiefly as the inspirer and
patroness of poets that she is famous. Such fragments of her
correspondence as we have before us reveal the fact that she was no
mean diplomatist. One of them especially breathes forth a noble spirit
of fearless faith. Rokn Eddin had raised an army of 800,000 men, and
was preparing to march against Georgia. Before setting out he sent an
ambassador to the queen, asking her to renounce Christianity and become
his wife, and concluding the letter with the threat that if she would
not submit, he would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>come and make her his mistress. The
ambassador who proposed such insolent terms would have been killed by
Tamara&rsquo;s courtiers if she had not protected him. She wrote back
calmly, expressing her trust in God, and declaring her determination to
destroy Rokn Eddin and his infidel hosts. She finishes with a truly
womanly touch: &ldquo;Knowing how careless your men are, I do not
return this by your messenger, but send one of my own servants with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Not contented with driving the Mahometans out of her own
land, she sent ambassadors to the Christian communities in Alexandria,
Libya, Mount Sinai, Jerusalem, Cyprus, Greece, and Rumania, to offer
them help if they needed it; and in order to secure orthodoxy in the
theology of her people, she commanded that a great disputation should
be held between the doctors of the Georgian and Armenian Churches.</p>
<p class="par">Her private life was not free from trouble. Three years
after her accession she was prevailed upon to marry a Russian prince,
Bogoliubovskoi, who had been driven out of his dominions in Muscovy.
This individual conducted himself towards his consort in a shameful
manner, and, after enduring his indignities for a long time, she
complained to the ecclesiastical authorities, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>granted her a divorce. She had no children by
her first husband, so the nobles of the kingdom pressed her to marry
again, in order that she might have an heir. Her beauty and her fame
brought her suitors from the most distant lands. Mahometans renounced
their religion for her, and there were many that died for love of her.
She chose Prince David Soslan, an Osset, who, by his bravery and
devotion, proved himself worthy to possess such a pearl among women,
and she bore him a son, called Giorgi Lasha, in 1194, and a daughter,
Rusudan, in 1195. Bogoliubovskoi, although he had been treated far
beyond his deserts, twice invaded Georgia, but without success.</p>
<p class="par">In 1212, wearied by her continual campaigns, and
sorrow-stricken at the death of her husband and her greatest general,
Tamara died, and left the throne to her son, <i>Giorgi Lasha</i>, at
that time eighteen years of age. The young king was no sooner crowned
than Ganja revolted, and this was soon followed by a still greater
calamity, the invasion of Genghis Khan. Giorgi led 90,000 troops
against the Mongols, but was defeated. In the meantime the Shah of
Persia had asked for the hand of the beautiful Rusudan, and the Shah of
Shirvan made a like demand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>Giorgi promised his sister to the
latter, but he died in 1223.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Rusudan</i> now became queen, and rejected both
suitors in favour of Mogit Eddin, Lord of Erzerum. The Sultan of
Khorassan thereupon desolated Georgia and took Tiflis, and the Persians
and Mongols together made terrible havoc for a time. Rusudan at last
submitted to the Mongols, and sent her son to the great Khan as a
hostage. Georgia had now sunk very low indeed, and in 1243, on the
death of Rusudan, her son, David IV., and her nephew, David V., divided
the kingdom between them. Henceforth Kartli and Imereti were
independent.</p>
<p class="par">For the next 200 years we read of nothing but battles,
sieges, raids, and in 1445 King Alexander completely destroyed the
unity of the kingdom by dividing it among his three sons. He gave
Kartli to Vakhtang, Imereti to Dimitri, Kakheti to Giorgi. In course of
time Mingreli, Guri, Apkhazi, Svaneti, all revolted, and the land
became the prey of Turks and Persians alternately, although even in its
distracted condition, its people never lost their bravery, and were
always respected by their enemies. Now and then the Mahometans
succeeded in conquering one or other of the provinces, but it was never
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>long before they were driven out again, and fire
and sword carried into their own land.</p>
<p class="par">Towards the end of the sixteenth century we find the
country divided between the two great Mahometan powers, who had long
made it their battle-field. Mingreli, Guri, Saatabago, and Imereti were
held by the Turks; Kartli, Kakheti, Somkheti, and Kartuban voluntarily
submitted to Persia, and were, in consequence, repeatedly devastated by
the Tatar allies of the Ottoman Empire. In 1586 King Alexander II. of
Kakheti sent ambassadors to the Tsar Feodor Ivanovich, asking for help,
and a treaty was signed, according to which the Russian monarch agreed
to protect Kakheti against the Turks, and to send troops to the
Caucasus for this purpose. Shah Abbas the Great made no objection to
this treaty, for he himself was anxious to gain the alliance of the
Muscovites against Turkey.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the seventeenth century King Giorgi of Kartli
also sought Russian protection, and it is probable that Russia and
Georgia would have been brought into very intimate connection by royal
marriages, &amp;c., if the death of Tsar Boris Godunov, and that of
King Giorgi, who was poisoned by order of Shah Abbas, had not broken
off the negotiations. The Persian Shah, suspecting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>King
Alexander of Kakheti of a treasonable correspondence with the Turks,
sent against him his (Alexander&rsquo;s) own son, Konstantin, who had
been brought up at the Persian Court, and had embraced Islam. This
apostate mercilessly killed his father and brother; but the nobles rose
against him, and almost annihilated his army, whereupon he fled to the
Lesghians, and offered to allow them to plunder Tiflis for three days
if they would help him. They agreed. The nobles were defeated, and the
land was again given up to the devastating infidels.</p>
<p class="par">King Teimuraz of Kakheti, grandson of Alexander, in
1619, from a hiding-place in the mountains, sent an embassy to the Tsar
Mikhail Feodorovich, beseeching him to have pity on his Georgian
fellow-Christians. The Tsar requested Shah Abbas to cease from
persecuting the Georgians, and his wish was granted in the most
friendly way possible. Not only was Teimuraz allowed to return to
Kakheti, but Kartli also was given to him, and remained a part of his
kingdom until 1634, when it was taken from him and given to Rostom, a
Mahometan. In 1653 Rostom took Kakheti also, and Teimuraz was obliged
to seek refuge at the Court of Imereti, whence he proceeded to Moscow
to ask for help; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>but in consequence of the war then being
waged against Poland, the Tsar could not spare any troops. Teimuraz
returned to Georgia, and was taken prisoner by the Shah.</p>
<p class="par">Imereti was at this time governed by King Bagrat, who
came to the throne at the age of fifteen, his stepmother, Daredjan,
being appointed regent. Daredjan endeavoured to gain the love of the
young king, who was already married to her niece, and on his refusal to
listen to her incestuous proposals, she had his eyes put out, and
married Vakhtang Dshudshuna, whom she proclaimed king. Assisted by the
Pasha of Akhaltsikhe, the loyal Imeretians replaced Bagrat the Blind on
the throne, and then the eyes of Vakhtang were put out, and he and
Daredjan were imprisoned.</p>
<p class="par">On the death of Rostom, in 1658, Vakhtang IV., of the
Mukhran family, became King of Kartli and Kakheti, and reigned till
1676. When he died his son Giorgi usurped the throne of Kartli, leaving
only Kakheti to his elder brother Archil, who journeyed to Moscow, but
did not get the desired aid from Russia. He then returned to the
Caucasus, five times succeeded in obtaining the crown of Imereti, and
five times was deposed. He died in Russia in 1713. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In 1703 Vakhtang V. came to the throne of Kartli. The
first seven years of his reign were spent as a prisoner in Ispahan. In
1723 there was a fresh invasion of Turks, and, thinking his kingdom
irrevocably lost, he fled to Russia, where he died.</p>
<p class="par">Shah Nadir usurped the crown of Persia in 1736, and
freed Kartli and Kakheti from the Turkish yoke. A little before his
accession, in 1732, Russia had renounced in favour of Persia all right
to the land between the Terek and the Kura. Nadir ingratiated himself
with the Georgian nobility, and always gave them the post of honour in
the victorious campaigns for which his reign is famous. Almost all the
great warriors of the land accompanied him on his Indian march of
conquest, and his especial favourite was <i>Irakli</i>, the son of
Teimuraz, King of Kartli and Kakheti. An interesting story is told
concerning the young warrior, in connection with this expedition.
Kandahar having been taken in 1737, Nadir was marching towards Scinde,
when he arrived at a certain column bearing an inscription which
foretold death to those who went beyond it. Irakli, at that time only
nineteen years of age, solved the difficulty by ordering the stone to
be placed on the back of an elephant, which was led before <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>the
army. Scinde was conquered, and Irakli was richly rewarded. The Shah
endeavoured to persuade the young prince to renounce the Christian
religion, but neither threats nor caresses prevailed. India having been
conquered, Nadir dismissed Irakli in 1739, and then invaded Central
Asia, taking Balkh, Bokhara, Samarkand, whence he returned to the
Caucasus and made war on the Lesghians. Irakli continued to distinguish
himself by great bravery. On the Aragva he defeated 2000 Turks and
Lesghians, was the first to cross the swollen river under a heavy
musketry fire, and killed the leader of the enemy with his own hand.
For this service Nadir bestowed upon him the kingdom of Kakheti in
1744.</p>
<p class="par">In 1747 Shah Nadir was assassinated, and a period of
anarchy began in Persia. Aga Mahmad Khan, the chief eunuch, usurped the
dignity of Shah. Teimuraz and Irakli saved Erivan from the Persians in
1748, and this city paid tribute to Georgia until 1800, when the
people, not wishing to fall into the hands of Russia, invited Persia to
take the place. In 1749 Irakli, with 3000 men, signally defeated 18,000
Persians at Karaboulakh and again saved Erivan; then Granja was taken,
the Lesghians were dispersed, and an alliance was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>made
with the Cherkesses. Teimuraz went to Russia in 1760; Tsaritsa
Elizabeth received him with great honour, and promised to send troops
to Georgia, but she died in 1761, and Teimuraz only survived her about
a fortnight.</p>
<p class="par">Irakli now succeeded to the throne of Kartli, and thus
reunited this kingdom to Kakheti. The Catholicos Antoni, the most
learned Georgian of his time, was recalled from exile in Russia and
made patriarch; he founded at Tiflis and Telav schools where the
&ldquo;new philosophy&rdquo; of Bacmeister was taught, translated many
educational works into his native tongue, reformed the Church and
encouraged literature.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">A plot was formed against the king&rsquo;s life in 1765,
under the following circumstances: Elizabeth, Irakli&rsquo;s sister,
had been married for three years to a certain Giorgi, son of Dimitri
Amilakhorishvili, who, for physical reasons, had been unable to
consummate the marriage. Elizabeth applied for and obtained a divorce.
Dimitri thought himself insulted in the person of his son, and he and
his friends began to conspire with Paata, a natural son of Vakhtang V.,
who had been educated in Russia and England, and had just arrived in
Georgia from the Persian court. Paata was to kill Irakli and proclaim
himself king. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>The conspiracy was discovered in time, and all
those who had taken part in it were punished with death or
mutilation.</p>
<p class="par">Solomon, king of Imereti, had, in the meantime, been
driven from his throne by the treachery of some of his nobles, who
delivered Kutais, Shorapan and other fortresses to the Turks. He
appealed to Catherine of Russia for help. Count Todleben arrived in the
Caucasus with 5000 men in 1769, and Kutais was taken back, and Imereti
freed from the oppression of the Turks. In the following year a great
plague devastated the whole of Transcaucasia, 5000 died in Tiflis
alone. The Holy Spear from the Armenian Convent at Edchmiadzin was
brought out, and the plague ceased; whereupon the Lesghians demanded
that the precious relic should be sent to them also; a spear was made
exactly like the holy one, and it produced the same beneficent effect.
Todleben was succeeded by Sukhotin, and in 1772, peace having been
restored, the Russians returned homeward. But no sooner were they gone
than the Turks again invaded Imereti; King Solomon, however, defeated
them with great slaughter, killing many with his own hand.</p>
<p class="par">Irakli&rsquo;s kingdom enjoyed comparative peace and
prosperity for a time, and advantage was taken of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>this
to disband the regular army and organize a militia, for the defence of
the country against the raids of the irrepressible Lesghians. The king
and his sons set an example to the people by subjecting themselves to
the same discipline as private individuals, and those who did not
present themselves for service were sought out and beaten with sticks.
In 1779 the Khan of Erivan refused to pay tribute, and strongly
fortified the city; the Georgians took the place and carried off
several Armenians, who were removed to Tiflis, Gori, and Signakh, where
they now constitute the trading and money-lending community.</p>
<p class="par">In 1795 happened the terrible catastrophe which was to
bring about the ruin of Georgia&mdash;the destruction of Tiflis by the
Shah Aga Mahmad. The Persians marched through Armenia in great force,
and reached the banks of the Kura without meeting with any serious
opposition. Their advanced guard was attacked by the Georgians just
outside the city, and was defeated on the 10th of September. Speaking
of this battle, the Shah himself said, &ldquo;I never saw so valorous a
foe.&rdquo; On the following day the main body arrived, and Tiflis was
taken by storm. King Irakli was so overcome with grief that he must
have fallen into the hands of the enemy had not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>a
few faithful nobles forcibly removed him from the captured city and
conveyed him to Mtiuleti, on the Aragva. Almost all the Georgian
artillery, thirty-five guns, was taken, and the city and its environs
were burnt to the ground.</p>
<p class="par">For six days the work of destruction went on; women and
young children were barbarously murdered, and the stench of rotting
corpses made the place uninhabitable. A Persian historian says,
&ldquo;The brave Persian army showed the unbelieving Georgians what is
in store for them at the day of judgment.&rdquo; All this havoc might
have been prevented if Russia had sent the troops which she had
solemnly promised by her treaties with Irakli, for the Shah had been
making preparations for the invasion four months before it took place,
and both Russia and Georgia were well aware of this.</p>
<p class="par">Prince Giorgi, unworthy son of such a father, had been
repeatedly ordered to bring his army to Tiflis, but he refused. No
sooner did he hear of the fall of the capital than he prepared to flee
from Signakh, although the place was strongly fortified, and there were
many armed men there; but the inhabitants refused to let him go, and it
was only by bribing his guards that he succeeded in escaping to Telav.
Not one of Irakli&rsquo;s sons served him in the hour of his need.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mtzkhet was captured and burnt, but the famous cathedral
was spared, at the entreaty of the Khan of Nakhitshevan, who
remonstrated against the desecration of the tomb of so many of
Georgia&rsquo;s brave kings.</p>
<p class="par">From Mtiuleti, Irakli proceeded to Ananur. The Shah sent
after him 8000 men, guided by one of the king&rsquo;s own courtiers,
but they were defeated. Aga Mahmad then offered to give up all the
prisoners as well as the citadel of Tiflis if Irakli would renounce his
treaty with Russia, and become tributary to Persia; but Irakli would
not hear of any terms, however favourable, which would force him to be
false to his alliance with Russia, although she, on her part, had
forsaken him. He quickly assembled an army and marched to the
southward, met the Persians between Kodjori and Krtsani and defeated
them, re-taking Tiflis on the 6th of October.</p>
<p class="par">A large Russian force now arrived and took Derbent,
Shemakha, Baku, and several other fortresses in Daghestan, but the
death of the Empress Catherine in 1796 put an end to the campaign, for
Tsar Paul recalled all the troops from Transcaucasia. In 1797 Aga
Mahmad Khan was again marching against Georgia, when he was fortunately
assassinated, like his predecessor Nadir. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>Plague and famine
came to slay those who had escaped the sword of the Persians, and,
worst of all, the great Irakli died in January, 1798, at the age of
eighty, after a career almost unparalleled in history. Frederick of
Prussia might well say, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Moi en Europe, et en
Asie l&rsquo;invincible Hercule, roi de
G&eacute;orgie.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Giorgi now succeeded to the throne, and entered into
negotiations with Persia, but Tsar Paul heard of the proposed alliance
and outbid the Shah. A treaty was signed, confirming the throne to the
Bagratid dynasty for ever, and promising military aid whenever it might
be necessary. Alexander, the king&rsquo;s brother, now raised a revolt,
which was put down with the help of the Russians; after all he had a
grievance, for Irakli&rsquo;s will declared that he was to succeed
Giorgi, while the Russians had persuaded the king to appoint as his
heir his son David, a major-general in the Russian army. Alexander now
appealed to Persia for aid, which he obtained, and in a three
hours&rsquo; battle at Kakabeti, on the Iora, he and Omar Khan, with an
army of 12,000 men, were defeated. Giorgi died in 1800, and Georgia was
then formally incorporated in the Russian empire.</p>
<p class="par">General Knorring, the first governor, proceeded to the
country with 10,000 men, and in the following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>year, under Tsar Alexander I., the annexation
was confirmed. In 1803 Prince Tsitsishvili, a Georgian, succeeded
Knorring. By his advice all the royal family were summoned to Russia,
&ldquo;in order to prevent civil dissensions,&rdquo; and this removal
was accompanied by a very unfortunate incident. Queen Maria, widow of
Giorgi, refused to go; General Lazarev proceeded early one morning to
the queen&rsquo;s sleeping apartments with some soldiers and attempted
to force her to accompany him; she killed him with a dagger which she
had concealed under her dress, and her young son and daughter stabbed
some of the soldiers. They were, of course, overpowered and carried
off; at Dariel, in the narrowest part of the pass, a few Tagaur Ossets
made a vain attempt at a rescue. Queen Maria was kept imprisoned in a
convent at Voronezh for seven years, and never saw her native land
again.</p>
<p class="par">Tsitsishvili set himself to improve the condition of the
country as much as possible. He began the military road over the
Caucasus in 1804. He succeeded in persuading King Solomon of Imereti to
acknowledge the Tsar as his suzerain, but Solomon soon began to
intrigue with the Turks again. After taking Gandja by storm, and
subduing a rising of the mountaineers under Pharnavaz <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>and
Iulon, sons of Irakli, Tsitsishvili marched against Baku, where he was
treacherously murdered by the Khan of that city in 1806.</p>
<p class="par">Count Gudovich was now appointed commander-in-chief, and
his courtesy won for him the friendship of the Georgian people. Kakheti
voluntarily submitted to his rule. He defeated the Turks in several
battles, but was unsuccessful in his attack on Erivan, where he lost
2000 men. He was then recalled and made governor-general of Moscow.
General Tormasov was the next ruler of Georgia, and he continued the
war against the Turks, who were aided by King Solomon of Imereti. Poti
was taken in 1810, and Princess Nina of Mingreli, who was allied to the
Russians, herself led her troops to the assault. Sukhum was also taken.
King Solomon was persuaded to go to a certain village in Kartli to sign
a treaty of peace with Russia. The Russians treacherously seized him by
night, and carried him off to prison in Tiflis, but he escaped in
disguise, and fled to Akhaltsikhe, where he was received by the Turks
with great honour. He returned to Imereti, and the whole country rose
in his favour. There were revolts in Kakheti, and even among the
Ossets, but they were soon crushed by force of numbers. Then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>came a plague which carried off vast numbers of
victims in Imereti.</p>
<p class="par">Tormasov was replaced by Paulucci, who, after a few
months, was, in his turn, superseded by Rtishtshef. In 1813 took place
the famous storming of Lenkoran, on the Caspian, by General
Kotliarevski, followed by the Gulistan Treaty of Peace, which was
signed on behalf of Persia by Sir Gore Ouseley, British ambassador at
Teheran.</p>
<p class="par">King Solomon died at Trebizond in 1815, and with him
ended the troublous existence of Imereti as an independent kingdom. In
about three and a half centuries thirty kings had sat on the Imeretian
throne, twenty-two of them were dethroned (one of them, Bagrat the
Blind, eight times), seven died a violent death, three were
blinded.</p>
<p class="par">Yermolov became governor-general in 1816, and soon
afterwards the Chechens and Daghestanians began to give the Russians
serious trouble. Then the clergy raised a national movement in Imereti,
in which Guri and Apkhazi joined, and in Mingreli, hitherto faithful,
the Dadian&rsquo;s brother revolted. All these efforts to shake off the
Russian yoke were, of course, fruitless, and they ended in 1822 with
the capture of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>Zakatali from the Lesghians. Then the Cherkesses
(Circassians) broke into rebellion, and in 1826 Persia again declared
war against Russia and marched 60,000 men into Georgia. Aided by the
Lesghians and the Kakhetians, under Alexander, son of Irakli, they were
at first successful, but the tide turned, and Erivan, Tavriz, and other
places saw Russia victorious.</p>
<p class="par">Paskevich succeeded Yermolov in 1827, and the peace of
Turkmenchai having been concluded with Persia, war was declared against
Turkey. The Russians took Kars, Poti, Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe, Bayazid
from the Turks, and in 1829 the belligerents signed the treaty of
Adrianople.</p>
<p class="par">In 1830 Kasi-mullah began his revolt, and brought about
a general rising among the Mahometan peoples of the Caucasus. Baron
Rosen, who took the command of the army in 1831, captured Gimri, and
Kasi-mullah was killed. Golovin (1837), Neidhart (1842), and Prince
Vorontsov (1844&ndash;1854) enjoyed comparative peace, and were able to
turn their attention to the internal condition of the country. Prince
Vorontsov especially deserves credit for his honest and painstaking
efforts to ameliorate the economic situation of Georgia, and it
flatters our national <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>pride to remember that that
statesman was English by birth and education, if not by blood.</p>
<p class="par">The pacification of Daghestan did not, as was expected,
follow the death of Kasi-mullah. A greater prophet and warrior arose to
take the place of the vanquished hero of Gimri. Shamil, after carrying
on a guerilla warfare for about ten years, raised the whole of the
Eastern Caucasus in 1843, and continued to inflict a series of crushing
defeats on the Russian generals who were sent to oppose him. The
declaration of war with Turkey in 1853 raised the hopes of the
Lesghians, but the utter incapacity of the Turkish leaders in Armenia
prevented the realization of those hopes. Everybody is familiar with
the incidents of Shamil&rsquo;s career down to the capture at Gunib in
1859; but it seems to me that too little attention has been devoted to
the remarkable religious system which inspired the Murids to their
marvellous deeds of valour. It is surely a noteworthy fact that the
mysticism of the Sufis should have been found to be compatible with a
purely militant faith like Islam.</p>
<p class="par">During the last thirty years little of interest has
happened in Georgia. The appointment of the Grand Duke Mikhail

railway and telegraph lines of communication, the founding of one or
two banks, schools, and other establishments of public utility, are the
chief events which the annalist has to chronicle. &ldquo;Free&rdquo;
Svaneti was conquered a few years ago, and, for the present,
Russia&rsquo;s supremacy is undisputed as far as the frontiers of
Turkey and Persia. Even the last war between Russia and Turkey was not
accompanied by any visible commotion among the peoples of the
Caucasus.</p>
<p class="par">There is as yet no <i>history</i> of Georgia in the
sense in which we now understand the word. Those works which are
dignified with the name are merely more or less trustworthy collections
of materials, which in their present form produce only a feeling of
bewilderment in the reader. We trust that a man worthy of the task will
seriously take the annals of his nation in hand, and present them to
the world in an intelligible form; and we also cherish the hope that he
will not finish his task without being able to chronicle the new birth
of a strong, independent state worthy to maintain the fame of Irakli
and Tamara. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=

<h2 class="main">THE LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE OF GEORGIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The origin of the Kartlian or Kartvelian language
is still involved in some doubt, but the general opinion of
philologists seems to be that it does not belong to the Indo-European
family, although it has been powerfully influenced by Zend, Sanskrit,
Persian, and Armenian. The ancient speech of the country is preserved
to us in the ecclesiastical rituals and books of devotion, which are
written in characters differing very considerably from the civil
alphabet, the &ldquo;war hand,&rdquo; the invention of the latter being
ascribed to King Pharnavaz I., a contemporary of Alexander the Great.
The <i>Khutsuri</i>, or ecclesiastical character, bears a striking
resemblance to Armenian; an excellent specimen of it may be seen in the
British Museum Library, in the famous Moscow Bible of 1743, recently
purchased. The number of letters is the same in both alphabets, viz.
thirty-eight, and the modern alphabet is as follows:&mdash;

<p class="par">The orthography is purely phonetic. There is very little
difference between the language of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>sacred books and that
of to-day, not nearly so much as between Anglo-Saxon and English; but
many foreign words have been introduced in modern times.</p>
<p class="par">The earliest specimens of Georgian literature which have
come down to us are translations of the Scriptures, and theological
works written under the influence of the Greek clergy, who, until the
eleventh century, occupied almost all the high ecclesiastical offices
in the land.</p>
<p class="par">In the eleventh and twelfth centuries of our era the
relations between Georgia and Greece were of the most intimate
character. The young nobles of the court of King David the Renewer and
his immediate successors frequented the schools of Athens, and brought
back with them Platonic and Aristotelian teachings which exerted a very
powerful influence on the intellectual and social life of that period,
and prepared the way for the golden age of Georgian literature, which
dawned on the accession of Queen Tamara. Sulkhan Orbeliani, in the
preface to his dictionary, compiled early in the eighteenth century,
says that he consulted translations of Proklus, Platonicus, Nemesis,
Aristotle, Damascenus, Plato, Porphyry, and many other Greek writers.
If these MSS. were still extant, they might prove valuable to classical
scholars.</p>

<p class="par">During the stormy times that soon followed, the
countless lyrical pieces which were produced were nearly all lost, but
the epic which is now looked upon as the greatest masterpiece in the
language has escaped with but a few mutilations. This is &ldquo;The Man
in the Panther&rsquo;s Skin&rdquo; (Vepkhvis Tkaosani) by <i>Shota
Rustaveli</i>.</p>
<p class="par">History tells us very little about Shota Rustaveli. We
only know that he was born in the village of Rustavi, near Akhaltsikhe,
that he received his education in Athens, returned to his native land,
where he wrote his great work, was secretary to Queen Tamara, then
became a monk, and died in the monastery of the Holy Cross, near
Jerusalem, where his portrait may still be seen. Tradition says that
the poet was passionately enamoured of his royal mistress, and this
assertion seems to be borne out by many passages in the poem.</p>
<p class="par">During nearly seven centuries of ceaseless struggles for
freedom, the Georgians have kept this great work fresh in their minds.
It has inspired them with hope and courage in the darkest hours, and at
the present day it is as great a favourite as it ever was. Not only are
many of its verses household words in cottage and hall, but there are
not a few Georgians, especially among the women, who know every
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>word of it by heart; indeed, there was a time
when no woman was allowed to marry unless she could repeat the whole
poem. The reason for this extraordinary popularity is to be found in
the fact that the poem is a thoroughly national one in its smallest
details. Although the heroes and heroines are described as Arabians,
Indians, Chinese, they are all Georgians to the very finger tips.</p>
<p class="par">The plot is of the simplest description possible.
Rostevan, a patriarchal Eastern king, who has renounced the throne of
Arabia in favour of his daughter Tinatina, is out hunting one day with
Avtandil, one of his generals, when he sees a weeping youth of wondrous
beauty, dressed in a panther&rsquo;s skin. The king orders his guards
to seize the stranger, but the latter kills several of them and
mysteriously escapes, whereupon the old king falls into a fit of
sadness so deep that Tinatina at length promises her hand to the knight
who will satisfy her father&rsquo;s curiosity. Avtandil sets out to
seek the man in the panther&rsquo;s skin, wanders about for three
years, meeting with wondrous adventures, before he finds the object of
his search, who turns out to be Tariel, a young knight enamoured of
Nestan Daredjan, daughter of the king of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>India, and then
returns to claim the hand of his queen.</p>
<p class="par">In Avtandil we have a Christian chevalier of the East
who is worthy of comparison with our Rolands and Red Cross Knights,
while Tariel is a wild Mussulman, whose passion drives him to excesses
worthy of Amadis of Gaul.</p>
<p class="par">The interest is powerfully sustained all through the
poem, and its dramatic unity is never lost sight of; yet, however
interesting the narrative may be, it is chiefly as a picture of life in
Georgia in the days of Tamara that &ldquo;The Man in the
Panther&rsquo;s Skin&rdquo; is valuable.</p>
<p class="par">Tinatina, who is none other than Tamara herself, is
described as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;One daughter only had the aged king,</p>
<p class="line">And she was fair as is the Eastern sun.</p>
<p class="line">He upon whom her gaze but once did rest</p>
<p class="line">Was ravish&rsquo;d of his heart and soul and
thought.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">Tinatina is a beautiful type of womanhood, such as
we might expect to find in the literature of Western Europe, but hardly
in a little country standing alone amid the wild hordes of Asia. Her
wisdom, her strength of character, the purity and loyalty of her love,
have made her the model of many a generation of Rustaveli&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>countrywomen, who have ever behaved nobly alike
in joy and sorrow.</p>
<p class="par">Avtandil is thus portrayed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A prince&rsquo;s son was Avtandil, the very
first</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Mong all the bravest warriors of the aged
king</p>
<p class="line">His form was slender as the cypress-tree,</p>
<p class="line">And clear and beauteous was his piercing glance.</p>
<p class="line">Though young, his soul was true and strong</p>
<p class="line">As adamant is hard.</p>
<p class="line">The fire from Tinatina&rsquo;s eyes had long</p>
<p class="line">Set his young heart aflame with strong desire,</p>
<p class="line">And stricken him with wounds that never
heal&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="line">Many a day he hid his burning love,</p>
<p class="line">And sunder&rsquo;d from his mistress, all the red</p>
<p class="line">Fled from his roselike, tender cheeks;</p>
<p class="line">But soon as fate did bring him near to her again,</p>
<p class="line">The wildly beating heart crimson&rsquo;d his face,</p>
<p class="line">And all his aching wounds did gape afresh.</p>
<p class="line">Thus hidden love doth torture youthful
breasts.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">From &ldquo;The Man in the Panther&rsquo;s
Skin&rdquo; we learn that the ideal hero of Rustaveli&rsquo;s times was
distinguished for bravery, truthfulness, loyalty to promises,
self-sacrifice, munificence, and burning love.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Falsehood&rsquo;s the root of all the thousand
ills</p>
<p class="line">That curse our race. Lying and faithlessness twin
sisters are.</p>
<p class="line">Why should I try to cheat my fellow-man?</p>
<p class="line">Is this the use to which my learning should be put?</p>
<p class="line">Ah, no! far other aims our hearts inspire,</p>
<p class="line">We learn, that we may near the angelic
choir.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The most famous line in the whole poem is, perhaps, the
one which says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;A glorious death is better than a life of
shame.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">And many a warrior has sought death, in the hour
of defeat, with these words on his lips.</p>
<p class="par">Another verse which has become proverbial is:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That which thou dost on other&rsquo;s wants
bestow, is thine,</p>
<p class="line">While that thou hoardest is all lost to
thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">The ideas of love expressed by Rustaveli are
partly of the Ovidian type, without any of the indelicacy of the Latin
poet. But he had not studied Plato for nought, and we see in his work
traces of those metaphysical theories which S. Bonaventura, Dante, and
many of their contemporaries and successors found in Christianity.</p>
<p class="par">In the last strophe we have a prophecy, conscious or
unconscious, of the evil days that were about to dawn.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Their deeds are ended, like a dream at
night.</p>
<p class="line">With them their golden age has ended too.</p>
<p class="line">Far other days have dawn&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="line">Such is that old deceiver Time; he makes</p>
<p class="line">That which at first did everlasting seem</p>
<p class="line">As short as is the twinkling of an eye.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">As far as style is concerned, we find that
Rustaveli <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>strikingly resembles the European writers of his
own time, to wit the troubadours, and we can easily imagine that his
career was not unlike that of some of those sweet singers who enjoyed
the favour of the noble ladies of France and Italy. Among the great
poets of Europe, Ariosto and Tasso are, perhaps, the ones who are most
akin to Rustaveli. The Platonism of the latter furnishes another ground
of resemblance, in addition to the similarity of theme.</p>
<p class="par">The poem in its present form consists of about 1600
quatrains. There are sixteen syllables in each line, and the four lines
end with the same rhyme. The rhythm is due to the accents, as in
English verse, and may be called hexametric, i.e. there are in each
line six feet, divided into two sets of three by means of the
c&aelig;sura; the fourth line invariably begins with the particle
<i>i</i>, which does not count as a syllable.</p>
<p class="par">As far as I know, the poem has not been translated into
any European language; although fragments and abstracts of it have been
published in Russian and Polish magazines, and I have seen the name of
&ldquo;Rostavvelo&rdquo; quoted in one of Gioberti&rsquo;s works. By
the publication of a carefully collated text, about a year ago,
Georgian critics have prepared the way for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>those who may wish to make the national epic
known to European readers.</p>
<p class="par">Among the contemporaries of Rustaveli may be mentioned
the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Chakhrukhadze</i>, the author of the
&ldquo;Tamariani,&rdquo; a long poem in honour of Queen Tamara; it is
composed entirely of epithets, thus:&mdash;</p>
<div lang="ka-latn" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tamartsknari, shesatsknari, khmanarnari,
pirmtsinari,</p>
<p class="line">Mse mtsinari, sachinari, tskalimknari,
momdinari,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">i.e.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tamara, the mild, the pleasing, the sweetly
speaking, the kindly smiling,</p>
<p class="line">The sunlike shining one, the majestic, the gently
moving, like a full river.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first"><i>Shavteli</i> was even more highly prized than
Rustaveli, but his greatest work is lost. <i>Khoneli</i> and
<i>Tmokveli</i>, the former in &ldquo;Daredjaniani,&rdquo; the latter
in &ldquo;Visramiani&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dilariani,&rdquo; have left us
romances of chivalry and adventure which are still much admired, and
are well worthy of comparison with the best European literature of the
same class. About the same time the national chronicle, called
&ldquo;Kartlis tzkhovreba,&rdquo; i.e. Georgia&rsquo;s Life, was
written.</p>
<p class="par">This period of literary activity was brought to an
abrupt close by the terrible invasion of Genghis Khan, and for about
four centuries the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>incessant wars in which the country was
engaged gave plenty of opportunity for acting romances, but little time
for writing them.</p>
<p class="par">Towards the end of the seventeenth century <i>Prince
Sulkhan Orbeliani</i> described his &ldquo;Journey through
Europe,&rdquo; and wrote a collection of fables and folk-tales, lately
published in Russian. Orbeliani had lived at the court of Louis XIV.,
and was very friendly with La Fontaine, who is indebted to the Georgian
prince for some of his fables. His greatest service to his country was,
however, the compilation of a dictionary, containing 25,000 words,
which has formed the basis for all later lexicographical works.</p>
<p class="par">In 1712 King Vakhtang VI. opened a printing office in
Tiflis, and issued the chief poems and romances of the Tamarian period
at such a price as to make them attainable by all his subjects. Irakli
II., of glorious memory, continued to act as the Augustus of Georgian
literature, and in the Catholicos Antoni it found a M&aelig;cenas or
Pollio. The chief writers of the eighteenth century were <i>Prince
Vakhusht</i>, son of Vakhtang VI., who compiled a &ldquo;History of
Georgia&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Geography of Georgia,&rdquo; and the
<i>Catholicos Antoni</i>, who published many educational and religious
works. <i>Guramoshvili</i> and <i>Savatnava</i> sang the triumphs of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>Irakli in powerful lyrics which are still
familiar to every peasant.</p>
<p class="par">The following serenade belongs to this period; it was
copied down by Pushkin in 1829, and he says of it, &ldquo;There is in
it a certain Oriental inconsequence which is not altogether devoid of
poetical worth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Soul newly born in Paradise!</p>
<p class="line">Soul made for my delight!</p>
<p class="line">From thee, thou deathless one,</p>
<p class="line xd21e2083">I wait for life.</p>
<p class="line">From thee, thou flowery springtide, moon but two weeks
old,</p>
<p class="line">From thee, my guardian angel,</p>
<p class="line xd21e2083">I wait for life.</p>

<p class="line">Nature&rsquo;s chief favourite! Hidden treasure
house!</p>
<p class="line xd21e2083">From thee I wait for life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">It was not, however, until the present century was
well begun, that Georgian poetry abandoned the &ldquo;Oriental
inconsequence&rdquo; to which I have just referred; the literary
awakening which began about sixty or seventy years ago was largely due
to the work of Western poets, such as Byron, with whom the Georgians
became familiar chiefly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>through Pushkin and Lermontov.
<i>Prince Alexander Chavchavadze</i> (1786&ndash;1846), a general in
the Russian service, was the founder of the modern school; his song is
all of love and wine. The influence of Western romanticism is still
more clearly visible in the earlier productions of <i>Baratashvili</i>
(1816&ndash;1846), but he succeeded in throwing off the gloomy
misanthropy of his youth, and had the courage to acknowledge that he
had been deluded by that &ldquo;evil spirit&rdquo; of Byronism.</p>
<p class="par">To <i>Prince Giorgi Eristavi</i> fell the task of
familiarizing his countrymen with the poetical literature of Europe. He
was exiled to Poland for his share in a plot against the Russian
government, and spent his leisure in studying Mickiewicz, Schiller,
Petrarch, and Pushkin, selections from whose works he published in his
native tongue. On his return to Tiflis he founded a National Theatre,
for which he himself wrote many comedies. With Eristavi sentimentalism
died, and the poets who succeeded him sought inspiration in patriotic
ideals.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Prince Grigor Orbeliani</i> (1801&ndash;1883), sang
the past splendour of his fatherland, and bewailed the low estate to
which it had fallen. In his &ldquo;Ode to Tamara&rsquo;s
portrait&rdquo; he beseeches the great queen to look down with pity on
Georgia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>and bless her sons with strength and wisdom; he
despairingly asks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Shall that which once was wither&rsquo;d,
ne&rsquo;er again</p>
<p class="line">Enjoy the fragrance of its former bloom?</p>
<p class="line">Shall that which fell, for ever fallen remain,</p>
<p class="line">O&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d in an unchanging, cruel
doom?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">His lines on the death of Irakli II. breathe the
same spirit:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ah! full of splendour were the fateful days</p>
<p class="line">That saw the quenching of thy quickening light,</p>
<p class="line">Thou sun of Georgia, yet thy dazzling rays</p>
<p class="line">Still lighten up the darkness of our night.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Thine all-o&rsquo;erpowering sword, whose mighty
blows</p>
<p class="line">Scatter&rsquo;d like chaff the bravest of the
brave,</p>
<p class="line">Shall never more affright thy country&rsquo;s
foes&mdash;</p>
<p class="line">Georgia&rsquo;s fame lies buried in thy
grave.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par first">Orbeliani had a warm heart for the poor and
suffering, and his &ldquo;Lopiana the Fisherman&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Bokuladze the Musha&rdquo; (a <i lang="ka-latn">musha</i> is a
carrier of heavy burdens) are masterpieces in their way.</p>
<p class="par">While Orbeliani&rsquo;s eyes are ever turned regretfully
to the past, <i>Akaki Tsereteli</i> (born 1840) looks hopefully forward
to the future:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Ah no! our love is not yet dead,</p>
<p class="line">It only sleeps awhile....&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">In elegant yet forcible lyrics he invites his
countrymen to manfully follow the path of progress. Tsereteli has
written a great historical poem <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150"
href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>called &ldquo;Torniki,&rdquo;
and is, besides, an orator and publicist of the first rank.</p>
<p class="par">Of the same school is <i>Prince Ilia Chavchavadze</i>
(born 1837), who is in many respects the most remarkable man that
Georgia possesses. All his poems, and indeed all his work, whether as a
poet, a novelist, a journalist, an orator, or a financier, breathe a
spirit of the loftiest patriotism. The return of spring and the
awakening of bird and flower to fuller life are to him a reminder of
the long-delayed awakening of his beloved land; his elegies on the
Kura, the Aragva, the Alazana are all full of the same feeling. It is,
however, in &ldquo;Lines to the Georgian mother&rdquo; that he most
clearly expresses his ideas; after reminding the matrons of Georgia how
they have served their country in times past, cheerfully sending their
sons forth to the fight and sustaining their courage in the hour of
misfortune, he says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;... But why should we shed idle tears</p>
<p class="line">For glory that will ne&rsquo;er return?</p>
<p class="line">The ever-flowing stream of years</p>

<div class="lg">

<p class="par first">Chavchavadze&rsquo;s tales and poems have done
more than anything else to awaken the Georgian people to a sense of the
duties they have to perform in the altered conditions under which they
now live. His poem, &ldquo;Memoirs of a Robber,&rdquo; which portrayed
the lazy country squires who lived on the toil of their serfs, made a
powerful impression on the class it was meant for; and the tale,
&ldquo;Is that a man?&rdquo; which describes the life of a young noble
who spends his whole time in eating, drinking, sleeping and folly,
brought a blush to the faces of hundreds of his countrymen, and
prompted them to seek a worthier mode of existence. At first, the more
conservative part of the nobility were bitterly opposed to the radical
ideas of Chavchavadze, but he has now succeeded in bringing round the
majority of them to his way of thinking. He is editor of a daily paper,
<i>Iveria</i>, which is read by all classes of society, and most of his
time is spent between his journalistic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>duties and the
management of the nobles&rsquo; Land Bank, an institution founded for
the relief of the farmers.</p>
<p class="par">Besides those I have mentioned, Chavchavadze has written
many other works; with the following extract from &ldquo;The
Phantom&rdquo; I conclude this brief notice of him:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;O Georgia, thou pearl and ornament of the world.
What sorrow and misfortune hast thou not undergone for the Christian
faith! Tell me, what other land has had so thorny a path to tread?
Where is the land that has maintained such a fight twenty centuries
long without disappearing from the earth? Thou alone, Georgia, couldst
do it. No other people can compare with thee for endurance. How often
have thy sons freely shed their blood for thee! Every foot of thy soil
is made fruitful by it. And even when they bowed under oppression they
always bravely rose again. Faith and freedom were their
ideals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The novel of social life is represented by <i>Prince
Kazbek</i>, a young and energetic writer, many of whose productions
have appeared as serials in the newspapers. The best writer of
historical novels is <i>Rtsheuli</i>; his &ldquo;Queen Tamara&rdquo; is
a great favourite with the people.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>new and original comedies by <i>Tsagareli</i>
and others, and <i>Prince Ivan&eacute; Machabeli</i>, who, as far as I
know, is the only Georgian who can read English literature in the
original, has translated some of Shakspeare&rsquo;s plays; these always
draw a full house, and are thoroughly appreciated. Leaving out of the
question &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; which has a special interest for the
people, on account of its reminding them of Irakli II., this hearty
admiration for Shakspeare is somewhat remarkable; in my opinion it is
to be explained by the fact that the Georgian people are in almost the
same state of intellectual and social development as were our
forefathers in the days of Queen Elizabeth, and they can, therefore,
the more fully enter into our great poet&rsquo;s way of thinking.
Besides the essential part of his work, the effect of which on the
minds of men will always be the same, there is an accessory part, a
tone, an atmosphere, which more particularly belongs to the early part
of a period of transition from feudalism to freedom, from faith to
rationalism, from the activity of war to the activity of peace; ten or
a dozen generations have lived in England since this stage in our
history was reached; in Georgia there still live men who were born in
the age of chivalry and adventure.</p>

after Prince Ilia Chavchavadze, the man who enjoys the greatest
influence among his fellow-countrymen. His studies at the University of
Paris, and his intimate acquaintance with the intellectual and social
life of Europe, have enabled him to bring the younger generation at
least to a fuller appreciation of the superiority of the West over the
East; everything which savours of Asia is now rigidly proscribed or
ridiculed, and Romano-Germanic ideals prevail. As the editor of
<i>Droeba</i> (Time), a capital daily paper, Machabeli had an
opportunity of spreading his opinions throughout the country, but an
imprudent article brought about the suppression of the journal by the
Censure.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE KINGDOM OF
GEORGIA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is well known that there are within the Russian
frontiers peoples not inferior in historical importance or intellectual
development to the regnant race, and we might reasonably suppose that
Russophobes would give us some information about those nations which
would probably be their allies in the struggle which they profess to
consider inevitable. Yet the course of action likely to be adopted by
Poland, Finland, or Georgia, in case of an Anglo-Russian war, is hardly
ever discussed, and when a passing reference is made to the matter, the
most erroneous ideas are expressed.</p>
<p class="par">As far as I know, the only living English statesman who
knows anything at all about the condition of the Caucasus, is Professor
James Bryce, who, in a work published in 1877, records the impressions
received during a short visit made in the previous year. His remarks
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>interesting in the highest degree, and exhibit a
rare keenness of insight; yet that part of them which refers more
particularly to Georgia is open to three very serious objections.</p>
<p class="par">1. The shortness of the author&rsquo;s stay forced him
to come to conclusions which a longer experience would have modified
very considerably. He himself frankly acknowledged this in many
places.</p>
<p class="par">2. Mr. Bryce did not come into contact with any
prominent Georgians; he was, therefore, obliged to depend upon
foreigners for information about the political condition of the country
and the aspirations of the native population. This is why he said so
little about Georgia in the last chapter of his book. In that chapter
the place of honour is reserved for the Armenians, whose recognized
champion our illustrious fellow-countryman has now become.</p>
<p class="par">3. There has, of late, been a great change in the
country. The Georgia of to-day is not the Georgia of 1876. Certain
causes, which will be touched upon in the present article, have, in the
meantime, brought about an awakening as sudden as it is complete.</p>
<p class="par">There is one Englishman who could accurately describe
the political condition of Transcaucasia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>and it is a subject
for congratulation that he is Her Majesty&rsquo;s Vice-Consul at Batum.
When the British Government wakes up to a recognition of the fact that
we have interests to protect in the region between the Black Sea and
the Caspian, the consulate in Tiflis (abolished in 1881, &ldquo;because
the objects for which it was founded were not accomplished&rdquo;) may,
perhaps, be re-established, and in that case no more able and
sympathetic consul could be chosen than Mr. D. R. Peacock, who for so
many years has upheld the honour of our flag in the fever-stricken
swamps of Poti and Batum.</p>
<p class="par">The writer of the present article is well aware of his
unfitness for the task he has set himself, yet he feels sure that the
result of his unprejudiced observation cannot fail to be interesting;
if he only succeeds in provoking adverse criticism he will be
satisfied, for thereby attention will be drawn to a question the
discussion of which must lead to a far better understanding of many
points of vital importance.</p>
<p class="par">At the very outset it is necessary to remove from the
mind of the reader an opinion which is almost universally held in
Europe, and which is, perhaps, the chief cause of that apathy with
which politicians look upon the Caucasus. It is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>generally believed, even by some of those who
have been in the country, that Transcaucasia is inhabited by a vast
number of tribes, more or less wild, having nothing in common but the
doubtful benefits of Russian rule. Nothing could be more misleading.
Students of ethnography may amuse themselves by making elaborate
investigations into the origin and characteristics of the Khevsur, the
Svan, the Pshav, the Osset, it is sufficient for us to know that all
these peoples are, politically at least, Georgians, and have fought
under the Kartvelian kings since the days of William the Conqueror.
Between the Caucasus, the Black Sea, the Caspian, and the frontiers of
Turkey and Persia, there are only three native peoples who deserve our
consideration, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">There are also many Georgians in Turkey, and a few in
Persia. The numerous local appellations given above mean no more than
Yorkshireman, Cornishman, or Aberdonian do to us. If I succeed in
impressing upon my readers the fact that <i>there is a politically
homogeneous region stretching from the steppe of Baku to the Black
Sea</i>, my labour will not have been fruitless.</p>
<p class="par">It is a significant fact that the pure Georgian language
is now far more generally spoken than it has been for many centuries,
and that the dialects are rapidly disappearing. This is due in a great
measure to the growth of a taste for literature, which is fostered by
the newspapers and other periodical publications. There are, besides,
many schools where the language is taught, for the Georgians have
hitherto escaped the fate of the Armenians, whose schools were closed
after the recent insurrection, and a society exists in Tiflis for the
dissemination of the national literature <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>among the peasants.
All this has helped to produce a national feeling, stronger than any
that has existed since the fatal partition of the kingdom in the
fifteenth century. The petty jealousies between Kartlian, Kakhetian and
Imeretian have been forgiven and forgotten, and when Georgia&rsquo;s
voice is again heard in Asia she will speak with that authority which
belongs only to a united, patriotic people.</p>
<p class="par">In order to understand the state of political feeling in
Georgia during the present century, it is necessary to remember what
her previous history has been. During a long period, stretching back to
ages of which we have only fragmentary records, the country had ever
been at war; often conquered, still more often conquering, never
crushed, this brave little state maintained its existence for a
thousand years, alone in the very midst of those fierce fanatics whose
fame made all allied Europe quake. At length, rent by civil war and
ravaged by the infidel, it wisely resolved to throw itself into the
hands of a Christian power able and willing to protect and avenge.
After availing themselves of Russia&rsquo;s help, it was but natural
that the Georgians should seek the repose of which they were so much in
need; and, though they were ever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>ready to fight against the
common foe, yet, with a few praiseworthy exceptions, they busied
themselves little with the internal administration of their land.
Indeed, there was no call for such interference as long as they were
under the mild and beneficent rule of that ideal Tsar, Alexander I.,
represented by such worthy lieutenants as Tsitsishvili and Yermolov.
They continued to live thus contentedly and, it must be confessed,
lazily for about two generations; only ten years ago it used to be said
in Tiflis, &ldquo;If you see a shopkeeper asleep, he is sure to be a
Georgian.&rdquo; This sleepiness is now at an end. Opinions may differ
as to the cause of the awakening; harsh measures on the part of Russia,
whose policy in Transcaucasia has been becoming more and more
irritating ever since the removal of Prince Vorontsov, in 1854, and
culminating last year in the enforcement of military service, have
undoubtedly had some effect of this kind, but unless there had been a
simultaneous progress in the intellectual and social development of the
nation, this overbearing legislation might have been sullenly submitted
to without complaint.</p>
<p class="par">There can be little doubt of the fact that the excessive
precautions taken by the police, with a view to put down political
agitation of any kind, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href=
"#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>have produced the very thing they
are intended to prevent. A country squire in talking to me, one day,
about a little market-town near his home, said, &ldquo;They have posted
a gendarme there. Until he came nobody ever bothered about politics.
Now there is nothing else talked of.&rdquo; Some time ago the young
Georgian nobles who were serving in the Russian army became infected
with the doctrines of revolutionary socialism, and not a few suffered
for their imprudence (e.g. the famous Tsitsianov, in 1877); at the
present time the national feeling has become so strong as to leave no
room for these ideas. Nevertheless, during my stay in Tiflis, last
summer, a rumour was rife to the effect that a large number (a hundred
or two) of young noblemen were about to be exiled, in view of the visit
of the Tsar, who was expected to arrive at his new palace at Tsinondal,
near Telav, in the autumn. The fact that this report was believed by
the parties interested, is a powerful testimony to the arbitrary
character of the proceedings of the Russian police.</p>
<p class="par">In the rural districts the people only know Russia as a
foreign power that sends them tax-collectors, justices of the peace,
and other civil servants, who perform obnoxious functions in a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>manner not calculated to conciliate the
ratepayers. It is notorious that the <i>chinovnik</i> has an unpleasant
reputation, even among his fellow-countrymen, and those who consent to
a temporary exile in Transcaucasia are not precisely the flower of the
profession, although their behaviour to Europeans leaves little to be
desired. The justices of the peace, as in Poland, are directly
appointed by the Minister of Justice at Petersburg; all the evidence
has to be translated into the official language, and this accentuates
the natural feeling of the litigants that they are being tried by
foreign laws arbitrarily imposed from without. The personal character
of the judges is, in many cases, not such as to inspire respect for the
law; the arrogant, bullying tone of these personages is intolerable at
any time, but especially when aggravated by alcoholism. I shall never
forget one scene in particular at which I was present; a fine, tall
mountaineer came humbly to present a petition to a puny, besotted
judge, who was a guest at the house where I was staying; the
representative of law and order was drunk, hopelessly drunk, and
treated the suppliant in such a manner that I blushed to be in his
company; I feared that the petitioner would take summary revenge for
the insult, but he restrained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>his wrath; as he turned away
there was on his face a look of hellish hatred, and I do not think that
he will trouble the court again as long as he has a sharp <i lang=
"ka-latn">kinjal</i> of his own wherewith to settle disputes.</p>
<p class="par">Whatever may be the cause of the awakening, there cannot
be any doubt of its reality. Nevertheless, it is hard to give any
definite description of the channels into which the national activity
is finding its way. In any case it may be safely said that the Georgian
people are not likely to imitate the imprudent conduct of their
neighbours the Armenians, who have, more than once, unseasonably
provoked popular movements which they had not the power to bring to a
happy issue. The character of the Georgians is too frank and open for
the hatching of plots; however strong their feelings may be, they know
how to wait until an opportunity arrives for the satisfaction of those
feelings; the perfect unanimity in the aims of the people renders an
elaborate organization unnecessary.</p>
<p class="par">It is interesting to notice that the political ideals of
the country are borrowed from Western Europe. Excepting in Japan,
perhaps, there is no such instance of a people passing directly from
feudalism to liberalism. The grandsons of absolute <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>monarchs, the men who little more than a quarter
of a century ago were large slaveholders, are now ardent champions of
the democratic idea, and loudly proclaim the freedom, the equality, the
brotherhood, of prince and peasant, master and man. This is not the
only case in which Georgia has turned her back on Asia and opened her
arms to Europe&mdash;Parisian fashions, German rationalism, English
sport and other products of our civilization are beginning to have an
influence; however, it is a consolation to remember that the women, in
every country the more Conservative and, at the same time, more
patriotic half of the community, may be counted upon to restrain their
husbands and sons from a too hasty advance in the slippery paths of
modern progress.</p>
<p class="par">It must not be supposed that the Georgian people are
forgetful of what Russia has done for them in protecting them against
Persia and Turkey; they have no hatred for their Slav fellow-subjects,
indeed, it is hard to imagine how any one could dislike such an amiable
individual as the average Russian, not being an official; but on the
other hand, it must be remembered that this military aid is the only
benefit Georgia has ever received. It is true that roads have been
made, but their construction was only undertaken in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name=
"pb166">166</a>]</span>order to facilitate the movement of troops, and
they are practically worthless for the purposes of trade. The
industrial and commercial development of the country has been wholly
neglected; and, at the instigation of the late editor of the <i>Moscow
News</i>, the transit of foreign merchandise was prohibited. At the
present time a few Russian capitalists are endeavouring to get a
footing beyond the Caucasus, but they experience some difficulty in
doing so, for the Georgians prefer to avail themselves of the services
of European investors; among others, the Rothschilds have not been slow
to see that Transcaucasian wines, ores and oils are worth
attention.</p>
<p class="par">Should Russia ever become involved in a great war,
Georgia would undoubtedly declare her independence, and endeavour to
seize the Dariel Road; the Armenians and Lesghians would also revolt,
each in their own way. It is idle to speculate as to the result of such
a movement, but it may interest the reader to know that it took an army
of more than a quarter of a million men to conquer the Lesghians alone,
in the time of Shamil. The Russians put so little confidence in the
loyalty of their Caucasian army, that they took care to send a large
part of it to Poland in January last, when there seemed to be a
prospect of war with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>Austria. This was a prudent measure; but,
after all, it does not matter so very much whether Georgian soldiers
mutiny in Georgia or Poland, Poles in Poland or Georgia, the essential
point at which diplomats hostile to Russia would aim is, of course, to
bring about perfectly simultaneous action on the part of all the
enemies of that power, both at home and abroad. It is superfluous to
add that the Georgian troops are the flower of the Russian army; every
schoolboy can ride and shoot like a trained man; their officers are
especially good, and there are at present many generals who are worthy
successors of Andronikov, Bagration and Loris Melikov.</p>
<p class="par">The sympathy with which the Armenian national movement
has been regarded in Western Europe encourages the Georgians to hope
that a like feeling will be manifested towards them when the time is
ripe for action. It is especially upon England that their hopes are
fixed, for they are well aware of the fact that the existence of a
strong, independent state between the Black Sea and the Caspian would
be an enormous advantage to our country. The possibility of Armenians,
Georgians and Lesghians consenting to combine into one homogeneous
state is not to be thought of; but there is no reason why the
descendants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>of the three sons of Targamos,
great-great-grandson of Noah, should not, if they were free, form a
defensive alliance for the protection of common interests; the
Lesghians have, in past times, done good service against both Persians
and Turks. In any case, Georgia has a frontier which she is quite able
to defend, and she could always count upon the assistance of the
mountaineers on the northern side of the Caucasus. The Cherkesses
(Circassians), whose hatred of Russia is well known, have almost all
migrated to Asia Minor.</p>
<p class="par">It is sincerely to be hoped that the present good
feeling between the Georgian and Russian peoples may continue. If they
were kindly treated, and trusted with some measure of local government,
I am sure that the Christian peoples of the Caucasus would never cause
the Tsar&rsquo;s ministers any trouble; but if an attempt be made to
crush the national spirit, the descendants of the men who fought under
Irakli will, at least, show despots how men can die. <span class=
